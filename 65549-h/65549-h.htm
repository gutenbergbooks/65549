<h2>Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>There have been greater queens in history,&mdash;Elizabeth
of England, Catherine
of Russia, Maria Theresa of Austria, and
others,&mdash;greater in diplomacy and statecraft
and power, but none purer, nobler, or lovelier
than Louise, Queen of Prussia, whose pathetic life
is narrated in this volume. No queen has suffered
more from the calamities inflicted upon her family,
from the personal insults of a victorious enemy, and
from the misfortunes which visited her country; and
no queen has been more deeply beloved. The
brutal attempt made by Napoleon to destroy her
reputation is one of the most disgraceful events in
his career. The insult was avenged sixty-five years
later, when her second son, William the Third,
vanquished Napoleon&rsquo;s nephew, entered Paris in
triumph, and was crowned Emperor of United
Germany at Versailles. She will ever remain in
history the ideal of a noble, beautiful woman of
refined character, lofty patriotism, charitable nature,
and exemplary goodness. The story of her sufferings
and of the patience with which she endured
them; of her love for her husband and children
and country, which never wavered, as told in this
little volume, must commend her to all who admire
purity, beauty, truth, and love.</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;The memory of the just is blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mother of Emperor William the
Victorious, Queen Louise of Prussia, a
woman of noble instincts, rich talents,
and a character purified in the crucible
of adversity, the guiding-star of her family and
her country in dark and troubled times, was born
March 10, 1776, in Hanover. Her father was
Prince Karl of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who later
became Duke, and still later, the first Grand Duke,
of that principality. He served under his brother-in-law,
the Elector of Hanover (who occupied the
throne of England as George III), as field-marshal,
and governor-general. Her mother, Frederika
Caroline Louise, was a daughter of Landgrave
George of Hesse-Darmstadt. Louise was her sixth
child, and lost her mother May 22, 1782, when
barely six years of age. In 1784 the Prince married
Princess Charlotte, the sister of the deceased;
but she died also in December of the following
year. This double loss deeply pained the sensitive
heart of the child, young as she was. The
sense of her loss and the longing for mother-love
accompanied her all through life and caused her to
give to her children all the tenderness that she had
so sadly missed in her own life, and tirelessly to
do for them as only a mother can. The twice-bereaved
husband took leave of Hanover in 1786
and removed to Darmstadt, where he placed the
princesses in the care of their wise and loving grandmother,
Landgravine Marie, whose darling the gay
and talented little Louise had already become.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>A French Swiss, Mademoiselle de G&eacute;lieu, was
engaged as governess, and proved an excellent
guardian for the lively and sometimes passionate,
then again very tender-hearted, little Princess. In
the education of the German Princess under French
influence&mdash;which unfortunately has been customary
at German courts and among the German
nobility since the days of Louis the Fourteenth&mdash;but
one thing was lacking, namely, instruction in
her mother-tongue and in the German literature,
which at that time was so rich in promise. This
was a loss which later she could not sufficiently deplore,
and which she strove with all her energy to
repair. But, on the other hand, her governess instructed
her from the beginning in the Word of
God, guided her in prayer toward faith, purity of
heart, and singleness of character, as well as toward
the royal road of charity and good works, from the
palace to the cottage of the poor and the bedside of
the suffering. Thus she had early training in the
practice of that graciousness and benevolence which
so endeared her to the hearts of her subjects.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Not only did Louise always retain a grateful devotion
to her preceptress, but the King, her husband,
also, was warmly attached to her and recognized her
as his own benefactress, for the services she had
rendered to his consort. When he returned in triumph
from Paris in July, 1814, four years after the
death of Louise, he took his way through Switzerland
and with his second son (afterwards Emperor
William the First), drove to Colombier, on the
Lake of Neuenburg, in the Prussian principality of
that name, to visit Mademoiselle de G&eacute;lieu, who
lived there with her brother. What a surprise it
was for the venerable matron when she saw an
elegant equipage draw up before her door and three
officers alight from it, in one of whom she recognized
the King of Prussia! The King remained
long in conversation with the noble woman who
had known his Louise as a child and had watched
her grow to maturity. Many were the reminiscences
they exchanged about the dear departed one,
who had been his most precious earthly possession.
He took an affectionate leave of her, and among the
rich gifts which he left behind, the most precious
was a shawl which the Queen had worn shortly before
her death, the sight of which moved the old lady
to tears. The King had carried with him in the campaign,
like holy relics, several objects which had
belonged to the Queen and which he particularly
prized; among them, this shawl, from which he parted
only as a mark of peculiar favor to one who had
been the teacher and motherly friend of his Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>The following story shows that the governess
moulded the will of the Princess, not so much by
command or compulsion, as through the reason,
and appeals to her tender and sympathetic heart.
After several quiet years in Darmstadt, Louise was
allowed to go with her grandmother to the old
imperial city of Strasburg on a visit to her aunt,
Countess of the Palatinate of Zweibr&uuml;cken, wife of
Maximilian, who became the first King of Bavaria.
We may imagine what an impression the splendid
cathedral made on the lively young girl. Of course
there was no peace until she was allowed to visit
the tower. As the ascent of the three hundred
and twenty-five steps was too arduous for her grandmother,
she was put in charge of the governess.
Delighted with the magnificent views of the Rhine
Valley and its surrounding mountains which the
platform afforded, she would have been only too
happy to climb the remaining four hundred steps
to the top of the tower. Now Mademoiselle de
G&eacute;lieu was loath to oppose her, but felt sure that
her grandmother would not approve of her ascent of
this difficult and dizzy height. As the Princess kept
urging her to consent, she said: &ldquo;The climb will be
very difficult for me; but as my duty demands that
I shall not leave you, go, and I will follow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>At this Louise immediately relented and replied:
&ldquo;No, indeed, I cannot, and I am sorry that I have
already made you climb so high!&rdquo; Thus, by an
appeal to her sympathies she was easily induced
to yield.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Louise particularly enjoyed two visits to Frankfort-on-the-Main,
during the coronation ceremonies of
the last two emperors of the &ldquo;Holy Roman Empire
of the German Nation&rdquo;; one of them was that of
the Emperor Leopold the Second (1790), and the
other that of the Emperor Francis (1792). Her
sister, married to the Hereditary Prince of Thurn
and Taxis, lived in Frankfort, and as her guest
Louise was enabled to see the last vestiges of glory
of the old empire. Wonderful pageants they were!
She beheld the imperial treasure brought from
N&uuml;rnberg and Aix-la-Chapelle with great ceremony,
in a state coach drawn by six horses, to the cathedral;
also the crown, sceptre, globe, and sword of
the Holy Mauritius, carried to the King; then His
Majesty, who had just been chosen by the seven
Electors, riding from his apartments in solemn procession
to the cathedral; before him, the seven
Electors in their official robes, over him a silk-embroidered
baldachin, borne by ten councillors of
the city of Frankfort; surrounding him, the imperial
court, and behind him the splendid procession of
the bodyguard and troops of the city with music
and waving banners; and lastly, a countless multitude
of followers, on foot, on horseback, and in
carriages.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In the cathedral, kneeling on the altar
steps during high mass, the King took the oath on the
Sacred Book of Aix-la-Chapelle, was then anointed
by the Elector of Mayence, gorgeous in his archiepiscopal
robes, and thereby made worthy to bear
the sword of Charlemagne. After taking the sacrament,
he ascended the throne with the crown upon
his head; then, amid the chanting of &ldquo;Lord God
we praise Thee,&rdquo; the tolling of the bells, and the
thunder of a hundred cannon, he was acclaimed
Emperor. The great coronation procession streaming
at last out of the cathedral proceeded to &ldquo;the
R&ouml;mer,&rdquo; over the bridge laid with cloth of the
imperial colors, which, as soon as it had passed,
was appropriated by the crowd. The hereditary
marshal of the empire, filling a vessel of silver from
a great heap of oats in the market-place, presented
it to the Emperor in token that the royal stables
were provisioned; the royal chamberlain offered the
silver ewer, basin, and towel; the dapifer brought a
glass from the fountain flowing with red and white
wine, and the royal treasurer, in the name of the
Emperor, scattered gold and silver coins from great
purses among the scrambling crowds. All these
scenes Louise had an opportunity of witnessing as a
privileged onlooker. With what childish delight,
but how modestly she regarded them! As member
of a family rich only in children, she made with her
own hands the satin shoes which were then in
fashion, and which she wore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>This natural and unassuming young girl was an
admirable companion for simple, domestic Frau
Goethe, mother of the celebrated poet, whom she
and her brothers and sisters were often allowed to
visit. On one occasion Louise and her brother
found the old lady enjoying a delicious German
salad with an omelette. It looked so appetizing
that they begged for a portion and never stopped
until they had eaten the last leaf. Another time,
the fourteen-year-old Louise and her sister Frederika
strayed into the paved court-yard, where they discovered
the well and began to pump with might
and main, until their governess espied them and
tried to put a stop to the prank. Their good-natured
old friend, Mistress Goethe, tried first to
pacify the irate governess, and when that failed,
locked her into a room until the sisters had pumped
to their hearts&rsquo; content. She said afterwards, that
she would have taken almost anything upon herself
rather than have interfered with their innocent fun.
When they bade her good-bye, the merry girls declared
they should never forget her and the good
times they had had in her house. When Louise
became Queen, she sent her old friend, among other
things, a piece of jewelry which Madame Goethe
wore only upon grand occasions, in her honor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>It was in Frankfort also where, not long afterwards,
she found the great happiness of her life.
The French Revolution, which had broken out in
1789, had grown constantly to greater and more
dangerous proportions. In order to assist the
threatened kingdom and its allies, who had taken
refuge in multitudes along the Rhine, King
Frederick William the Second of Prussia entered
into an alliance with Austria. The French National
Assembly quickly declared war, in April, 1792.
Under command of the venerable Duke of Brunswick
the campaign in France was so mismanaged
that the Allies were obliged to retreat, and the
French got possession of Mayence and on October
23, 1792, took Frankfort and burned it. The city
was recovered December 2, but Mayence had to be
besieged. The King of Prussia established his
headquarters in Frankfort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>On the outbreak of hostilities the Landgravine of
Hesse-Darmstadt and her two granddaughters took
refuge with their older sister, the Princess of Hildburghausen.
From there the Landgrave, who was
in the suite of the King, sent for them in order to
present them to His Majesty, whose consort was
also a native of Darmstadt. When the presentation
had taken place, the grandmother intended to proceed
with her charges that same evening to Darmstadt,
but was detained by an invitation to the
royal table. Here the twenty-three-year-old Crown-prince,
Frederick William, saw the seventeen-year-old
Louise. The charm and graciousness of her
bearing, her delicate and youthful figure, and the
sweetness of her voice affected him; and when she
looked at him with an almost frightened expression
in her large blue eyes, an inner voice seemed to say
to him, as years afterwards he used to relate, &ldquo;It
must be she, or no one else on earth.&rdquo; Louise had
the same feeling; and a clear realization of their
destiny (so the King declared in his reminiscences
of that exalted moment) brought tears of joy to the
eyes of both.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>The same evening, Prince Frederick Louis Karl,
three years younger than his brother, fell in love
with the fifteen-year-old Frederika. The brothers
had been close comrades from childhood, and now,
through their devotion to the two blooming sisters,
they were drawn closer together than ever before.</p>
<p>The Crown-prince, who had borne himself gallantly
in the French campaign, was given command
of a regiment during the siege of Mayence; but the
impression made upon him by Louise was not to be
dimmed by the turmoil of war. During several
visits to Darmstadt he became more intimately acquainted
with the beloved, grew to appreciate her
lovely nature, and being sure of himself, he sought
and obtained the consent of his father to their union.
A month after the first meeting, April 2, 1793, the
double betrothal was celebrated in the palace at
Darmstadt in the presence of the King of Prussia
and the sisters of the two <i>fianc&eacute;es</i>. Two days later
both Princes returned to the field with their father,
and six days afterwards the Crown-prince, at the
head of his battalion, took the village of Kostheim
by storm. His brother, betrothed of Princess Frederika,
came very near losing his life one evening
from an overheated stove, as he was resting in his
tent after an arduous day. Everything about the
sleeping Prince was already in flames, when a sentinel
who had smelt the smoke rushed in and rescued
the unconscious Prince from certain death. The
tent was consumed, and the Prince saved nothing
but the clothes on his back. The next day the
serious and somewhat practical Crown-prince conceived
the humorous idea of going to the King and
among his suite, and soliciting contributions in aid
of the &ldquo;poor burned-out man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>The Princesses ventured into the camp several
times to visit their betrothed. During one of these
visits at Bodenbach, near Mayence, May 29, 1793,
young Goethe, who was staying there, had an
opportunity of seeing them from his tent near by
and was so entranced with both sisters that they
seemed to him like &ldquo;heavenly visions&rdquo; which he
could never forget. There is but one voice concerning
the gracious charm of Louise, as Princess
and as Queen. She appeared to those who knew
her almost like a supernatural being. Her intimates
called her an angel. The poet Fouqu&eacute;, who saw
both lovely sisters on their entry into Berlin, spoke
of the &ldquo;angelically beautiful brides.&rdquo; The King
called his gracious daughter-in-law &ldquo;the Princess of
Princesses.&rdquo; Even a man of intellect like the court
physician, Hufeland, tells us in after years of that
&ldquo;indescribably blissful feeling&rdquo; which one always had
when in her presence, &ldquo;as if in the presence of a
heavenly being.&rdquo; Old Bl&uuml;cher, on hearing of her
death, cried: &ldquo;Our saint is now in Heaven!&rdquo;
May we not also look up with deepest reverence to
her who was glorified while still upon earth?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The Crown-prince, who was now burning to distinguish
himself and to prove worthy of his beloved,
was particularly valiant in the siege of Landau, at
which he had command of the royal guard. However,
two months later, November 27, 1793, he and
his brother were recalled from the field by the King,
who had grown tired of the war in consequence of
disagreements among the Allies. In the meantime
the Crown-prince&rsquo;s palace, in which Frederick William,
as Crown-prince and as King, lived and died,
was being newly furnished and made ready to receive
the young pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise as Crown-princess of Prussia</span></h2>
<p>On the seventeenth of December, Louise
and her sister left Darmstadt, which had
become like home to them. Accompanied
by their father and the widowed
Landgravine, their grandmother, they travelled by
way of W&uuml;rzburg, Hildburghausen, Weimar, Leipzig,
and Wittenberg to Potsdam, where they arrived
on the twenty-first of December. In the outskirts
of this city of Frederick the Great, they were met
by bands of citizens on horseback, carrying the
Prussian and Mecklenburg colors, and there sixteen
postilions gave them the first salute of welcome.
The Brandenburg arch in Potsdam had been furnished
with a special gate of honor by the citizens.
The street leading westward from this gateway was
renamed in honor of the Princess, and the open
square before it was called Louise Square. On their
arrival, toward evening, all the windows were illuminated
and the streets lighted with torches. The
guild of butchers in Potsdam particularly distinguished
itself. The masters, in brown coats with
gold shoulder-straps, red, gold-bordered vests, and
high, three-cornered hats with gold tassels, cockades,
and red pompons, carried curved hussar sabres and
bestrode horses decked with red trappings, and were
preceded by three lusty trumpeters and the waving
banner of their guild. In memory of this occasion,
when (in 1804) the old banner was discarded, Queen
Louise presented the honorable guild with a handsome
new one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>The entry of the Princesses into Berlin took place
on the twenty-second of December. Both Princes
escorted their brides-to-be from Potsdam. The
guilds and societies of Berlin assembled in the village
of Sch&ouml;neberg, an hour distant, in order to ride
in front of the carriage of state. Six postal secretaries,
at the head of forty trumpeters in new festal
garments, led the torch-light procession from
Sch&ouml;neberg. Next to these came the company of
carters in blue; next, the Berlin guild of butchers
in blue; the sharpshooters in green with peach-colored
trimmings; a company of Berlin citizens in
old knightly costumes; the brewers and maltsters
in blue; two companies of young clerks; and at the
end, the merchants of the three guilds in red and
blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The streets were lined with soldiers of the
royal guard and gentlemen of the court. Thus
Louise, with her sister, was received and conducted
to the capital, everything being done to honor and
delight her. Poetical tributes were not lacking, and
the tact and grace with which she received the
homage, her wit, and the sincerity of her manner,
laid the foundation for that profound reverence and
love with which the people of the city always regarded
her. At the gates and in the streets of
Berlin, the entry became a veritable triumphal procession.
Rows of the civil guard and countless
masses of the populace lined the streets all the way
to &ldquo;the Linden&rdquo; and the Crown-prince&rsquo;s palace,
where an arch of honor had been erected, and thirty
boys from the French colony and forty young
maidens presented her with a festival poem, which
ended with the verse:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Forget what Thou hast lost;</p>
<p class="t0">This day of joy shall be the promise of a happier life;</p>
<p class="t0">Hail to Thee! mother of future monarchs,</p>
<p class="t0">A Queen and blissful wife!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The young girl who presented a crown of blossoming
myrtle and recited the poem with much taste
and feeling was so lovely in dress and manner that
Louise, yielding to the dictates of her heart, bent
suddenly toward her, took her in her arms, and
kissed her.</p>
<p>The Countess von Voss, a dignified courtier and
Mistress of Ceremonies, standing just behind the
Princess, was horrified at this unusual procedure and
tried to put a stop to it. But she was too late!
How dreadful that the future Crown-princess of
Prussia should have embraced and kissed a child of
the common people!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;what has Your Royal
Highness done! It is against all custom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; answered Louise, innocently, &ldquo;can I
no longer follow the dictates of my heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who witnessed this scene were carried away
by the sincerity and sweetness which the kiss and
these words so spontaneously and naturally revealed.
The procession passed on to the castle through
rows of Berlin working-men, and it was not until
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon that the Princesses
found themselves in the midst of the royal family
and by the side of their betrothed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Two days afterwards, on Christmas eve, 1793,
the marriage of the Crown-prince and Louise took
place in the White Hall of the castle. It was solemnized
by the consistorial councillor, Dr. Sack,
who had baptized and confirmed the Prince. In
order to allow the citizens to participate as fully as
possible in the ceremony the King had given orders
that as many admission-cards should be issued as
would fill the hall. Most of them fell to officials
of the royal household, who crowded the
apartments, wearing their gorgeous court uniforms.
Out of patience on seeing how his wishes had been
misinterpreted, the King said to the Master of
Ceremonies: &ldquo;Could you not gather enough embroidered
collars about you? I wish to see the
wedding garments of the citizens also; on the day
after to-morrow no cards shall be issued, but all shall
be admitted who have whole coats to their backs!&rdquo;
Therefore, on the twenty-sixth of December, at the
wedding of Prince Louis and Frederika, the multitude
which was admitted left so narrow a passage
for the rather corpulent King, who was leading the
widow of Frederick the Great, that he turned and,
thrusting out his left elbow, called genially to his
Berliners: &ldquo;Do not mind, children! No one
must expect to spread himself on such an
occasion!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>On the evening of the Crown-prince&rsquo;s wedding-day
the citizens had planned a beautiful illumination
of the city. While expressing his thanks on hearing
of the plan, the Crown-prince said: &ldquo;It would
give me far more pleasure if those who have something
to spare would give the money which the
lights would cost, to the widows and orphans of
those who have fallen in battle.&rdquo; No sooner said
than done. The King, the Princes and Princesses
contributed large sums, so that the joy of this
Christmas and marriage festival was reflected in
many a careworn face and many a humble home.
The next morning, on Christmas Day, the newly
married pair, with their attendants, drove from the
castle to the cathedral. After attending the services,
and thus having consecrated the first day of
their married life, they drove to their own palace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>This was, and still is, an unostentatious building
and furnished in exceedingly plain style. But it
pleased the Crown-prince, who was simple in his
tastes by nature and education; and it also satisfied
Louise, who was not at all fond of show. When,
after the King&rsquo;s death, Frederick William the Third
might and should have removed to the castle, he
preferred to remain in the simpler dwelling as
long as he lived. When his children became dissatisfied,
he would say to them: &ldquo;You wish to
make a show in the world, forgetting how it was
with me at your age. On my birthday I received
a pot of heliotrope worth threepence, and when my
tutor wished to give me an unusual treat, he would
take me to a coffee-garden and order twopence
worth of cherries.&rdquo; To a newly married son, whose
house he had fitted up in princely style, he remarked:
&ldquo;I had no such splendors when I married
your mother. I can only wish that you may live as
happily and contentedly as we have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In marked contrast to the usual brilliant, vain,
superficial court life of the period, a new life now
began in the Crown-prince&rsquo;s palace. A simple, old-fashioned
household was established, a shining example
of German family life, of simplicity, love, and
faithfulness. Both husband and wife avoided as
much as possible any contact with the unsavory
persons who frequented the court of Frederick
William the Second as satellites of the celebrated
Countess Lichtenau.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>The young couple ignored the French custom of
formal address and used the more intimate &ldquo;thou.&rdquo;
The King noticed this with displeasure and called
them to account with the words: &ldquo;I hear that you
call the Crown-princess &lsquo;Thou&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Crown-prince answered: &ldquo;For very good
reasons.&rdquo; And on being asked what these reasons
were, replied: &ldquo;With &lsquo;Thou&rsquo; one always knows
where one stands, but with &lsquo;you&rsquo; all is uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his exalted station he had, at best, but little
freedom, and even when King he &ldquo;wished to enjoy
in his home life some of the independence that belongs
to every private citizen.&rdquo; He was not so
much in his element at court as at home &ldquo;with his
wife.&rdquo; When she had laid aside the necessary
trappings of fashion and stood before him in her
plain gown and ordinary attire, he would look at
her as upon a pearl newly restored to its pristine
purity; then he would grasp her hand with a radiant
expression and exclaim: &ldquo;Thank God! that you are
my wife once more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when she would laughingly ask: &ldquo;How, am
I not always your wife?&rdquo; he would reply, sighing
jocosely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no! All too often you are obliged to be the
Crown-princess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The unfortunate Mistress of Ceremonies had her
troubles in consequence of this disregard of court
etiquette. Once she read the Prince a French lecture
on the influence of etiquette in the history of
the world. With a very chastened air, he said:
&ldquo;Very well, I will submit myself. Announce me to
my consort and inquire whether I may have the
honor of waiting upon Her Royal Highness, the
Crown-princess. Say that I should like to present
my compliments and hope that she will graciously
receive me.&rdquo; Highly delighted with such a result
of her sermon, the good lady went ceremoniously
to the Crown-princess to beg an audience in the
name of His Royal Highness. But what a surprise
was in store for her! As she entered the room she
found the Crown-prince, who had hurriedly preceded
her by another passageway, already &ldquo;with his wife&rdquo;;
and laughingly he calls to the crestfallen lady:
&ldquo;You see, dear Voss, my wife and I meet as often
as we like unannounced. This is a good Christian
custom, I believe. However, you are a splendid
Mistress of Ceremonies, and henceforth shall be
called &lsquo;Madame Etiquette&rsquo;!&rdquo; The good lady had
a similar experience afterwards at a festal procession
of the Court. The order of ceremonies read that
&ldquo;Their Royal Highnesses must appear in the state
carriage drawn by six horses, with two coachmen
and three royal riflemen in uniform.&rdquo; The Crown-prince
allowed the Mistress of Ceremonies to make
all the arrangements according to precedent. Punctually
the grand coach drew up before the palace,
the Crown-prince appeared with his consort, but
instead of entering it with her, he gently pushed the
Mistress of Ceremonies inside, closed the door, and
ordered the coachman to drive on with the prisoner.
With his Louise, he then seated himself in an ordinary
carriage with only two horses and drove to
the castle, where, according to orders, the coachman
drew up behind the state coach, from which
at the same moment &ldquo;Madame Etiquette&rdquo; was
alighting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Louise, brought up in comparative freedom and
in the sunshine of love, was in complete sympathy
with this spirit of fun, which was a token of
domestic happiness. She had the most fortunate
influence over this husband, who was generally
silent, reserved, harsh, and often seemingly morose,
because of his strict and severe education, which she,
with her frank and innocent nature, most happily
supplemented.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>When she celebrated her first birthday in Berlin,
March 10, 1794, the King, who was very fond of
her, presented her with the pleasure palace &ldquo;Oranienburg&rdquo;
and a splendid park on the river Havel.
Ladies and gentlemen of the court appeared before
her in the costume of Oranienburg and, as it were,
in the name of the inhabitants, presented the keys
of the castle to its new mistress. Louise was full of
joy and gratitude, but she could not keep it all for
herself. On the King&rsquo;s inquiring if she had any
other desire, she could only wish for a handful of
gold, so that the poor of Berlin might share her
good fortune. Smilingly the King remarked that it
only depended on how large she imagined the handful
of gold to be. Never at a loss for an answer, she
quickly replied: &ldquo;The handful of gold should be just
as large as the heart of the kindest of kings.&rdquo; So
the poor of the capital received a share of the royal
largess, and the birthday joy of the noble woman
was complete. As an after celebration she, with her
sister, gave a banquet for the servants, each of whom
was allowed to bring several guests. The next day,
on hearing that there had been eighty at table,
Louise scolded them good-naturedly for not having
made the number a full hundred.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>In the following May, the King and the Crown-prince
were obliged to take the field against the
Poles. When the news came that at the storming
of Wola the Crown-prince had led the company
next after the King&rsquo;s against the intrenchments,
she said: &ldquo;I tremble for the dangers to which my
husband is exposed; but I feel that as he is next
to the throne, he should also be close to the King
in the field.&rdquo; Soon after his return, October 7,
1794, she gave birth to a still-born daughter in
Oranienburg. This was in consequence of a fright
and fall on the stairs. She was all the happier,
when, a year later at the same place, she bore a
son who became Frederick William the Fourth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>In spite of the many agreeable features of the
castle and the town on the Havel, the young pair
did not feel quite at home there. It was too magnificent
for them, and the surroundings were too
noisy. They longed for a quieter, more retired
summer residence, where they could live with fewer
restraints, although they often went driving in the
forest in an ordinary farm wagon and without any
servants, in spite of the protests of the Mistress of
Ceremonies, who could never be induced to accompany
them. Therefore, when the Prince learned
that the estate of Paretz, pleasantly situated among
the fields two miles from Potsdam, was for sale, he
purchased it together with the village which belonged
to it, for thirty thousand thalers, which the King
paid for him. The old residence was torn down
and a new one built in plain country style. &ldquo;Keep
in mind that you are building for an ordinary country
gentleman,&rdquo; he instructed the architect. It was
to be merely comfortable and homelike, without any
costly furnishings, embroidered carpets and tapestries,
silken covers, or velvet hangings; and afterwards
when King, he said that while there he wished
to be regarded only as &ldquo;the squire of Paretz.&rdquo; His
wife, too, on being questioned by a visiting princess
as to whether Her Majesty was not bored to death
by being immured for weeks at a time in this hermitage,
answered: &ldquo;No, indeed, I am perfectly
happy as the mistress of Paretz.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>The happy pair now enjoyed all the pleasures of
country life&mdash;hunting and boating, the forests and
gardens, harvest festival and country dance. Even
as Queen, the lovely, high-born dame often forgot
her exalted station and joined the ranks of the peasants
and their girls and gayly danced among them.
Even &ldquo;her excellency&rdquo; Madame von Voss, the Mistress
of Ceremonies, led out by the &ldquo;master of
Paretz,&rdquo; was obliged to take part in a dance.
Another of the Queen&rsquo;s pleasures was to buy a
basketful of cakes at the annual fair of Paretz and
to distribute them among young and old. The
children who joyfully cried out, &ldquo;Madame Queen,
Madame Queen, give me some too!&rdquo; she led to the
toy booths, where honey cakes and peppermints
were raffled off, bought them tickets, and rejoiced
with them over their sweet winnings. In the year
1802 she clothed all the children in the village in
new garments for the harvest-home; and when the
girls and boys leading the procession entered the
castle to tender their thanks to the royal giver, she
was as happy as any of them. Turning to the King,
she quoted: &ldquo;Ye shall become as little children.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>This love and appreciation of nature and child-life
always remained characteristic of her. With so
many duties and demands upon her, she was obliged
to take a few hours&rsquo; rest daily to refresh her spirit
and renew her strength. This repose she found
most readily in the solitude and beauty of nature.
&ldquo;If I neglect this hour for collecting my forces,&rdquo;
she once remarked, &ldquo;I am out of sorts and cannot
endure the confusion of the world. Oh, what a
blessing it is to be able to commune with our souls!&rdquo;
It is evident that one of such deep emotional nature,
at such times did not merely lose herself in dreams
or ponder idly on her own affairs. She had been
accustomed from childhood to collect and assimilate
the best that human art and science have to offer.
In proof of this, we have her essays, journals, and
letters. The works of the great poets, Herder,
Schiller, Goethe, and others, were her companions
and the springs of her spiritual and mental refreshment,
next to music, which she loved to cultivate.
She interpreted the songs of her country with a voice
full of feeling. But alas! there were hours in store
for her, when all that genius has to offer could not
still the suffering of her heart!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The first hour of trial came when her brother-in-law,
Prince Louis, died of typhoid fever, December
28, 1796, leaving her sister Frederika an eighteen-year-old
widow. She was married a second time, in
1798, to Prince Frederick William of Braunfels;
and after he died, in 1814, she became the bride of
the English Prince Ernst August, Duke of Cumberland,
and as such, Queen of Hanover, in 1837. A
fortnight after Prince Louis&rsquo;s death (January 13,
1797) the widow of Frederick the Great, the unhappy
Queen Elizabeth Christine, whom Louise had
regarded with tender and filial reverence, passed
away in her eighty-second year. &ldquo;It will be my turn
next,&rdquo; said the King, on receiving the news of her
death. Two months after this, on the twenty-second
of March, 1797, Louise bore her second son,
Prince William, and on the sixteenth of November
of the same year, the King&rsquo;s prophecy was fulfilled.
Frederick William the Second died; his eldest son
ascended the throne, and Louise was Queen of
Prussia. What a change in so short a time!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise as Queen</span></h2>
<p>The new King took the throne of Frederick
the Great, not as his successor,
&ldquo;Frederick the Third,&rdquo; as he was acclaimed,
but more modestly, with the
title of Frederick William the Third. His wife
assured the delegation of citizens who waited upon
her to offer the congratulations of Berlin, that she
was most grateful for every proof of their love, and
that she and the King would both endeavor to deserve
it; for, said she: &ldquo;The love of his subjects is
the softest pillow for a royal head.&rdquo; The residence
and mode of life of the royal pair remained unchanged.
The King still refrained, as before, from
all stiff formalities and vain and ostentatious display.
His father, who had had extravagant tastes, left him
nothing but debts, and now they were obliged to
retrench. But even had it been otherwise, Frederick
William the Third and his Louise were happiest in
living a simple life. On a serving-man&rsquo;s opening
both the folding doors for His Majesty to pass
through, he asked: &ldquo;Have I grown suddenly so
stout that one door is not wide enough for me?&rdquo;
And when the <i>chef</i> put two more courses on the
King&rsquo;s bill-of-fare than he had served to the Crown-prince,
the King struck them off, with the words:
&ldquo;Does he think my stomach has grown larger since
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>It was an old court custom that two generals
should serve standing during meals, and that the
chamberlain should be obliged to attend the ruler
until he had tasted his first glass of wine. At his
first state dinner, when Frederick William the Third
saw the Master of Ceremonies standing behind his
chair, he said to him: &ldquo;You may sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not allowed to,&rdquo; was the answer, &ldquo;until
Your Majesty has taken the first drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is any particular beverage mentioned?&rdquo; asked
the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so far as I know,&rdquo; replied the Master of
Ceremonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said the King. He reached for the
nearest glass of water, drank, and said: &ldquo;Now I
have had my drink, and you may be seated!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Queen Louise in the same manner retained her
simple habits. She appeared in robes of state only
when the dignity of her station demanded it. Her
usual dress at balls and festivals was a dainty muslin
gown, her beautiful hair decked only with a diadem,
and about her neck a long string of pearls. In the
course of time, by setting a new example, she also
brought about the disappearance of trains yards in
length, of the great hooped skirts, and towers of
artificial hair. With her fine tact she knew how to
banish all stiff formality from social life, and to secure
natural and unaffected intercourse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The royal pair were often seen, as of old, walking
arm in arm &ldquo;under the Lindens&rdquo; and in the zo&ouml;logical
gardens, without any attendants and mingling
with citizens in the market-place. In the Winter
of 1797, Louise went with her royal consort to the
Christmas street-fair in Berlin. They had made
purchases at several booths and approached another,
where a woman was bargaining for some wares.
She broke off immediately and was going to step
aside as she saw the royal pair approaching. &ldquo;Do
not go, my dear woman,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;What
will the merchants say if we drive away their customers?&rdquo;
Then she inquired about her family and
on learning that the woman had a son about the
same age as the Crown-prince, she bought several
toys and gave them to her with the words: &ldquo;Take
these trifles, my dear, and give them to your crown-prince
from mine.&rdquo; When out walking she often
took up children who were playing by the roadside,
and embraced them in motherly fashion. Even the
old dame cowering by the wayside was not unnoticed,
and if she did not need an alms, received at least a
friendly word. One day a little boy playing horse
in the castle garden ran into the Queen. Her lady-in-waiting
was about to scold him roundly, but
Louise interfered with: &ldquo;A boy must be wild.&rdquo;
Tapping the little fellow on his red cheek, she said
in sweetest tones: &ldquo;Run and play, my son, but
take care not to fall; and you may give your parents
greetings from me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>A great many little episodes of this kind made her
day by day more beloved among the people. Once
while she was Crown-princess, when a Count and
a court shoemaker were announced at the same
moment, she caused the craftsman, whose time no
doubt was the more valuable, to be admitted first,
with the words: &ldquo;Let the shoemaker come; the
Count can wait.&rdquo; To an elderly man, who was
invited for an evening, she wrote on the invitation
card sent out by the Mistress of Ceremonies the
words: &ldquo;I beg that you will come in boots. Silk
stockings are dangerous for your health, and as I
am fond of my friends, I must take care of them,&rdquo;
Old General K&ouml;ckeritz, who was a daily guest at
table during their country sojourn, had a habit of
disappearing after the meal, no one knew whither.
When Louise learned that he hurried away to his
room to smoke his indispensable pipe, she appeared
beside him the next day as soon as dinner was over,
with a filled pipe, a lighted taper, and a spill in her
hand, and said to him: &ldquo;To-day, my dear K&ouml;ckeritz,
you shall not desert us; you shall smoke your
customary pipe in our company.&rdquo; After she became
Queen, she and the King were once invited by
one of their ministers to a ball. On their arrival
there were several carriages already before the door
yard. The gate was about to be opened that the
royal carriage might pass through, when the King
forbade it and waited until his turn came to alight.
The Queen remarked to the minister&rsquo;s wife who was
waiting to receive them: &ldquo;You must forgive us for
being late, but my husband was detained by business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>At this same ball, when she noticed that a
pretty woman had not been asked to dance by the
titled gentlemen, because she was a &ldquo;commoner,&rdquo;
she begged the King, who was nothing loath, to dance
with her himself. At a function in Magdeburg the
Queen greatly embarrassed a young officer&rsquo;s wife by
asking from what family she came. As the young
woman was the daughter of a rich merchant of
Magdeburg she did not know what to reply, and
stammered: &ldquo;I am of no family, Your Majesty.&rdquo;
The bystanders giggled, but the Queen rebuked
their levity with a severe glance, and, turning graciously
to the young woman, she said in a loud
voice so that all might hear: &ldquo;Ah, I see that you
have answered in jest and I must admit that I used
a false expression. Certainly all men are born
equal, though indeed it is very gratifying and inspiring
to be of a good family. Who would not
rejoice to come of distinguished parents and ancestors?
But thank God, they are to be found in
all classes! Indeed, the greatest benefactors of the
human race often spring from the humblest homes.
One may inherit high station and its privileges, but
inner personal worth everybody must cultivate for
himself. I thank you, my dear lady, that you have
given me an opportunity to express these thoughts,
which are worth while pondering, and I wish you
in your married life that happiness which springs
only from the heart.&rdquo; She had emphasized these
significant words with her little fan and with a significant
gesture she dismissed the distinguished ladies
who had been presented to her. How consoled and
elated she, who felt that she was &ldquo;of no family,&rdquo;
must have been!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>The following is a similar incident:
At Potsdam, at a church service for the
soldiers, a woman strayed by mistake into the place
that had been reserved for the Queen, and was
taken very harshly to task by the Master of Ceremonies.
When Louise heard of this, she was very
much distressed, sent for the preacher at once, and
as he entered the door, met him with the words:
&ldquo;In Heaven&rsquo;s name, what has happened in your
church? I have just learned with great displeasure
that a worthy lady of your congregation has been
humiliated by Mr. von N. And right in the
church, too! I am inconsolable, although it was not
my fault I beg of you to apologize for me and to
bring me at dinner the assurance that she accepts
the apology. And to-morrow you may bring her
with you&mdash;I shall take pleasure in making her
acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Louise accompanied her husband to Koenigsberg,
where the Prussians did homage to their new King
on the fifth of June. On the way thither, at Stargard,
nineteen little girls in white dresses, with baskets
of flowers, were drawn up before the house
where the Queen was lodged. Louise talked with
them like a mother and they became very confidential
and told her that there had been twenty of them,
but that one of their number had been sent home
because she was so homely. &ldquo;Poor child!&rdquo; cried
the Queen, &ldquo;no doubt she had been anticipating
my coming with delight and is now at home crying
bitterly.&rdquo; Immediately she had her fetched and
distinguished the homely little one beyond all the
others, with her attentions. The next day there was
a review, and the populace crowded close round the
royal pair. The Queen, noticing an old countryman
trying in vain to get nearer, sent a servant to
bring him to her. At a village near K&ouml;slin the
burgomaster begged her to alight, as the peasants as
well as the citizens were anxious to entertain her.
She gladly consented and entered a peasant house
which had been decorated for the reception, and
enjoyed the omelettes which were served her as
much as, in the old days, she had enjoyed the one
in Madame Goethe&rsquo;s house. It was regarded at
that time as an unprecedented condescension, at a
banquet at Oliva, that on the Queen&rsquo;s invitation a
number of Danzig women were allowed to sit down
with the guests of honor. In Koenigsberg and also
in Breslau and along the route of her travels, the
amiable and gracious lady won all hearts, and it was
not a Prussian, nor a flatterer, who wrote after her
death: &ldquo;Few Queens have been beloved as she was
during her lifetime, and very few have been thus
mourned after their death.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>On July 6, 1798, the deputies of Brandenburg
paid their homage to the King in Berlin. Eight
days after this, Louise&rsquo;s first daughter was born&mdash;she
who became the wife of Czar Nicholas of
Russia.</p>
<p>During the gala days of the accession Louise
wrote to her grandmother: &ldquo;I am Queen; and
what pleases me most about it, is that now I shall
not have to limit my charities so carefully.&rdquo; But
indeed, for the nonce the King was obliged &ldquo;to live
on the Crown-prince&rsquo;s income&rdquo; and to contrive
means to pay his father&rsquo;s debts. Therefore the
Queen had no larger income than the Crown-princess,
or about one thousand thalers a month.
How could this suffice for one who had calls and
solicitations from every side? Indeed, after a few
years, she was involved in three times as much debt
as her income amounted to, so that the cabinet councillor
was obliged to represent to the King that she
could not possibly make two ends meet on this income.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The King paid her debts, but ordered that in
future she must keep an account of her expenses
and that they should be paid out of his purse and
the bills be laid before him.</p>
<p>But it was not enough, and Louise was obliged to
ask a loan from the treasurer. He applied to the
King, but the loan was refused, and he returned
to the Queen with the words: &ldquo;Really, Your
Majesty, this can go on no longer; you will pauperize
yourself with your charities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise answered: &ldquo;I love my children; to be
the mother of my subjects is as sweet to me as to
know that my best of husbands is their father. I
must help wherever there is need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I will speak to the King,&rdquo;
answered the official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in such a manner that he will not be
angry!&rdquo; begged the Queen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Soon afterwards she found the empty drawer of
her writing-desk newly filled, and she asked the
King: &ldquo;What angel has done this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling, the King answered: &ldquo;His name is legion;
at least I know no other name, and I know
but one angel [at which his eye rested on her].
But you know the beautiful saying&mdash;&lsquo;to his friends
he gives even in his sleep.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus loving and beloved throughout the broad
expanse of her country and among its people, as well
as in her home circle, she was the happiest of wives,
mothers, and princesses. But all too soon the sun
of her happiness began to decline.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise in Misfortune</span></h2>
<p>From the abyss of the French Revolution
Napoleon Bonaparte arose, to be emperor
of the French, the rod of princes, and the
scourge of God for the people of Europe.
Austria had been conquered, southern Germany lay
at the feet of its &ldquo;Protector,&rdquo; and Prussia too must
be crushed. In 1805 Austria and Russia had allied
themselves with England and Sweden to bring the
conqueror to terms. All the countries were preparing
for war. Prussia alone remained quiet and
refused every call to arms. Napoleon offered Hanover
as the price of an alliance; Austrian and Russian
envoys were endeavoring to gain the King over
to their side. He, however, could not decide for
either, and clung to his neutrality. Czar Alexander
sent word that he should march 100,000 men
through southern Prussia and Silesia to join the
Austrians. If the King permitted this, it would
mean war with France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>He had scarcely taken
steps to avert this danger when Napoleon made another
decisive move. Without either giving notice
or asking permission he sent a division under General
Bernadotte, October 7, 1805, through the Prussian
territory of Ansbach, to avoid a detour and to
fall on the rear of the Austrians. The consequence
of this violent measure was the penning up of the
Austrian General Mack in Ulm and the downfall of
Austria. This disregard of territorial rights in thus
entering Prussian domain, called forth a storm of
indignation in Berlin, and with reason. The King
declared that without ample reparation, war with
France was no longer to be avoided. And what
did Napoleon do? In a message to the King he
treated the whole matter as trifling. Perhaps no
one was more deeply affected by this indignity and
by the misfortunes of Austria than the tender, pure-hearted
Queen. She had never been accustomed to
concern herself with political affairs; but when her
eldest son, on his tenth birthday, October 15, 1805,
appeared for the first time in the new uniform which
his father had given him, she expressed the deepest
feelings of her heart in the words: &ldquo;I hope, my son,
that on the day when you shall make use of this coat,
your first object will be to revenge your brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Russia and Austria wished to take quick advantage
of the indignation against Napoleon in order to
bring Prussia over to their side. The Czar and
Grand Duke Anton, brother of Emperor Franz,
both came to Berlin. The result of this conference
was the treaty of November 3. According to this,
Prussia was to mediate between Napoleon and the
Allies. In case Napoleon did not accept the peace
proposals, then Prussia promised to join the Allies
with 180,000 men. Before the Czar left Potsdam
he expressed a desire to visit the tomb of Frederick
the Great. After midnight, together with the King
and Queen, he visited the Garrison Church of Potsdam
and the illuminated crypt. He kissed the
coffin, offered the King his hand across it, and swore
eternal friendship. On leaving the church he entered
his travelling carriage and drove away to join
the army.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Unfortunately the man entrusted with the Prussian
negotiations was the entirely incompetent Minister
Haugwitz. He was completely in the hands
of the French party at court and, like it, was without
love of country, sincerity, or real devotion, but on
the contrary was bent on neutrality. Unfortunately
the King, distrustful of himself by too severe
education, did not possess enough independence of
character and strength of will to see through and to
break up the powerful clique which surrounded him
and was leading the State to destruction. By nature
he was more inclined to consideration and procrastination
than to quick decision and prompt execution.
The most capable statesmen, like Stein and
Hadenberg, who alone could have saved the State,
could do nothing against the so-called neutral party.
Had the King only had some of the decision of the
gifted Prince Louis Ferdinand, a son of the youngest
brother of Frederick the Great, it might have been
otherwise. This Prince, full of burning enthusiasm
for the honor of the Prussian State and the army of
Frederick the Great, was at the head of the patriotic
party which Napoleon called the war party. He
criticised that so-called highest statesmanship, which
wished Prussia to be friendly with all its neighbors,
and in consequence of which it was regarded with
suspicion by all the States. &ldquo;By love of peace,&rdquo;
said Prince Louis, with clear insight, &ldquo;Prussia
maintains a peaceful attitude toward all the powers,
and some day when they are ready for war, it will
be mercilessly crushed. Then we shall fall without
hope, and perhaps even without honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Louise would have nothing to do with Prince Louis
Ferdinand, who wasted his powers recklessly in a
round of pleasures. Soon after Louise had come to
Berlin, he became enamoured of the beautiful Crown-princess
and attempted, with the help of her inexperienced
sister Frederika, to ingratiate himself
with her and thus destroy the happiness of the
princely pair. But the virtue of this pure woman
spared herself and her family this tragedy.</p>
<p>On which side the Queen stood in this burning question
of the day need hardly be asked. Inspired by
the glory of Frederick the Great, completely devoted
to her Prussia and its people, she was concerned only
with Prussia&rsquo;s honor. With all the strength of her
soul she held to Schiller&rsquo;s motto: &ldquo;The nation is
unworthy which will not sacrifice all to its honor.&rdquo;
It is true that, entirely unfitted by nature and by
calling for politics, she had lived in the sweet belief
that her country, guided by its peace-loving King,
would be able to maintain peace. But now she
realized, quoting Schiller once more, that &ldquo;even
the most pious cannot keep the peace, when it does
not please his quarrelsome neighbor.&rdquo; She took
Napoleon&rsquo;s deed of violence in Ansbach as a personal
insult to her beloved husband, and saw visions
of a still darker future. Therefore she preferred
war or even annihilation to such humiliation. In
the Fall of 1805 the celebrated Field-marshal
Gneisenau wrote: &ldquo;The Queen is very much in
favor of war. She has told the French ambassador
that the King would himself take command of
the troops, and that the nation would sacrifice its
blood and treasure to preserve its independence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>When Napoleon heard of the alliance with Russia
and Austria he is said to have exclaimed: &ldquo;The
King of Prussia shall suffer for this!&rdquo; While he
was rapidly preparing to take the field against the
Russian and Austrian armies in Moravia, Count
Haugwitz was not at all in a hurry. He did not
reach Br&uuml;nn until November 28, then found no
time during an audience of four hours to accomplish
his mission in the spirit of the Potsdam agreement,
but allowed himself to be despatched next day, out
of this dangerous neighborhood, to Vienna. Here
he waited until, on December 2, the battle of the
three Emperors, at Austerlitz, was fought, an armistice
concluded between Napoleon and the Austrians,
and the Russian army forced to retreat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>When at last, on December 13, Haugwitz obtained
another interview with Napoleon he was greeted
with the angry words: &ldquo;It would have been far
more honorable if your master had openly declared
war on me; then at least he might have been of
some service to his new allies. But you wish to be
everybody&rsquo;s friend, and that is impossible; you must
choose between me and my enemies. I want sincerity,
or I withdraw. Open enemies are preferable
to false friends. My enemies I can attack wherever
I find them.&rdquo; Then he laid before the Prussian
Minister an agreement whereby Prussia was to
enter into an alliance, offensive and defensive, with
France to give up Ansbach to Bavaria and Neuenburg
to France in exchange for Hanover. On
December 15 Haugwitz signed this treaty by means
of which Prussia was to become the first vassal of
France. What astonishment it caused in Berlin
when Haugwitz presented the Sch&ouml;nbrunn treaty,
on December 25! The King did not wish to accept
it, but could not refuse, for that would virtually
mean a declaration of war against the conqueror of
Russia and Austria. Hanover was indeed occupied,
but the army was placed on a peace footing, and
Haugwitz was to transform the offensive and defensive
alliance into a purely friendly understanding.
But Napoleon well knew what he could offer the
good, undecided, badly counselled King. &ldquo;No
power in the world shall make me uphold the
treaty. If Prussia now wants Hanover, she shall
pay dearly for it. Your King does not know what
he wants; some reckless spirits are urging him toward
war. I tell you it cannot end well.&rdquo; On
February 15, Haugwitz was forced to sign a still
more distasteful treaty, which was likely to cost the
friendship of England. The King, who was unprepared
for war, was obliged to sign this Paris
treaty, March 3. After this first humiliation of
Prussia, Napoleon proceeded to exhaust the patience
of the most patient, until Prussia was obliged, as
Napoleon had desired, to declare war, but now
without allies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>Queen Louise was sorely troubled by all this.
Her health had suffered during the Winter and in
April she was still more shaken by the death of her
sixteen-months-old son. With this death her saddest
days began,&mdash;for one who had looked upon the
world so gayly and been accustomed to dispense
happiness to others. She first sought and found
strength at the baths of Pyrmont, where she met
her beloved father, who had become Duke of
Mecklenburg-Strelitz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Not until her six weeks&rsquo;
stay at the sanatorium was ended did she learn, on
returning to Berlin, that war had been determined
upon. Concessions had become useless, for Napoleon
already treated Prussia as a vassal. On August
9 the King had given orders for the mobilization of
the entire army. Negotiations were under way with
Austria, Russia, and England in order to effect an
understanding. But Austria was too much weakened,
Russia too far away, and even England could
not give immediate assistance. So Prussia remained
isolated, and its shortsightedness and slothfulness
during the previous year brought forth sad fruit.
One more attempt was made to conciliate Napoleon.
He declared that he would attack Prussia with all
his forces before Russia could come to its assistance,
but that all might still be well, if Prussia would
immediately disarm. What Napoleon expected of
the King when he was disarmed was clear to everybody,
and to no one more so than to the Queen.
When, on her return, she learned what had been determined
upon as consistent with the honor and
well-being of the fatherland, she advocated the war,
highly as she valued peace. The arch-enemy of
Prussia learned this and made use of it by charging
that she instigated the war. The newspapers
which he controlled began rude attacks upon this
splendid woman in order to lower her in the eyes
of her people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>Had she suspected the real condition of the
army, a state of affairs which the King only began
to realize when war was at hand, she might have
counselled otherwise. But her high opinion of the
army of Frederick the Great was confirmed by the
confidence of its officers. General R&uuml;chel, who had
retaken Frankfort from the French, was so fatuous
as to declare that the Prussian army had plenty
of field-marshals equal to General Bonaparte. A
colonel deplored the fact that the heroic army of the
great Frederick should be furnished with cannon,
rifles, and swords for the battle with the French, instead
of clubs with which &ldquo;to beat back these dogs.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Why do we need fortifications?&rdquo; asked another.
&ldquo;Our fortress is the army, behind whose invincible
ranks we can defy the enemy.&rdquo; Even a few days
before the battle, when the Prussian army was
virtually surrounded, a Prussian general staff officer
declared that the enemy was already cut off by their
clever strategy and Napoleon &ldquo;as certainly ours as
if we already had him in this hat.&rdquo; But what was
the real state of affairs?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The fortresses were in bad condition, the commanders
were weak dotards, the strategetical points
unoccupied, so that in case of retreat the road to
the capital was open to the enemy. The superior
officers were old and graduates of Frederick&rsquo;s antiquated
school of war, and the younger ones full of
patrician insolence. The army itself was not in training,
and consisted principally of recruited foreigners.
The commander-in-chief was superannuated.</p>
<p>In the conduct of the war, as in the King&rsquo;s
cabinet, there was discord and indecision. The
King at length became sadly conscious of this. &ldquo;It
cannot end well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There is indescribable
confusion; the gentlemen will not believe this, and
say that I am too young and do not understand. I
hope that I may be wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the clear-sighted Prince Louis Ferdinand
uttered these sad words three days before the engagement
at Saalfeld, in which he fell: &ldquo;Alas! we
are in a bad way, and so is our whole Prussian army;
I consider it already lost, but I shall not outlive its
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The Prussian troops were to concentrate in
Thuringia under the leadership of the old Duke of
Brunswick for a decisive battle against the thus far
unconquered one. The previous year, when war
seemed imminent, Louise, with her children, had
bidden the departing troops a hearty and enthusiastic
farewell on the Wilhelmsplatz. Napoleon reproached
her with this as though she had been
the demon of war. When, in September, 1806, the
Queen&rsquo;s dragoon regiment left Berlin to take the
field in Thuringia she received it at the Brandenburg
Gate clad in the colors of the regiment, and rode at
its head through the streets which it traversed. This
also gave her enemies food for comment. But when,
on September 21, she even accompanied the King,
who was lost without her, by way of Magdeburg
and Halle to join the army at Naumburg, Napoleon
found even more fault with her. The celebrated
politician Gentz, who was Austrian court-councillor
at the time, had an interview with the Queen in
Erfurt. This temperate statesman had heard so
many praises of the high-born lady that he was quite
prepared to find them only false flatteries. But in
a conversation lasting three-quarters of an hour, she
charmed him completely. He could not say enough
about the decision and independence which she
displayed, the fire and at the same time the wisdom
of her language. &ldquo;And yet, in all that she said she
showed such deep feeling that one could not forget
for a moment that it was a feminine intellect which
attracted one&rsquo;s admiration.&rdquo; This man of the world
and of courts declared that he had never seen such a
combination of dignity, benevolence, and charm as in
this wonderful woman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Louise was most anxious to be assured that public
opinion was in favor of the campaign. &ldquo;I do
not ask to give myself courage&mdash;for, thank God!
that is not necessary!&rdquo; said she, during the conversation,
in which she showed an astonishing knowledge
of even the most unimportant events and
minute affairs. Her womanly nature manifested itself
most touchingly when her eyes would fill with tears
at the mention of Austria&rsquo;s misfortunes. Commenting
on the public criticisms of her political
conduct, she cried: &ldquo;God knows that I have never
been consulted in public affairs and have never
wished to be. Had I ever been asked, I should&mdash;I
will admit it&mdash;have declared for war, as I believed
it was necessary. Our condition had become so
critical that we were in duty bound, and at all costs,
to extricate ourselves; it was most necessary to put
an end to the suspicion and reproaches which were
heaped upon us, as though the King had not been in
earnest in regard to the war all the time. By every
principle of honor and therefore of duty, as I understand
it, we were compelled to follow that road,
apart from any selfish considerations.&rdquo; The accusation
of any partiality for the Russians she denied,
and although she did justice to the personal virtues
of the Czar Alexander, she did not look upon
Russia as the saviour of Europe from the usurper.
She sought the principal means of help solely in
the close union of all those who bore the German
name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Among those surrounding the King, opinions
were divided as to whether or not the Queen should
be allowed to go farther. She herself preferred to
be at headquarters rather than to hear disquieting
rumors at a distance. Since the King had allowed
her to accompany him beyond Erfurt, she was resolved
not to leave him until he desired it. Headquarters
were established in Weimar, October 11,
and there the King and Queen received the first bad
news. The vanguard had been defeated by the
French and their leader, the brave Prince Louis, had
fallen at Saalfeld, October 10. Three days later the
Queen left Weimar to follow her husband to Auerst&auml;dt.
On the way she learned that the road was
beset by the enemy, and she was obliged to return
to Weimar amid the cheers of thousands of eager
soldiers, whose valiant spirit she had imbued with
fresh life. Here she was urged by General R&uuml;chel
no longer to expose herself needlessly to the dangers
of war, and to return to Berlin. This was possible
only by means of a great detour, in order to be safe
from the enemy&rsquo;s scouting parties. R&uuml;chel designated
the road and the stations. The route, which
would take four days to traverse, was to be by
way of M&uuml;hlhausen, Brunswick, Magdeburg, and
Brandenburg.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>On the morning of October 14 the Queen left
Weimar with the Countess Tauentzien. A company
of cuirassiers formed their escort for several miles;
thick mist enveloped the landscape and the travellers&rsquo;
hearts were heavy with forebodings. As Louise
listened to the distant thunder of cannon she trembled
for the husband of her heart and the father of
her children. She knew that he would shun no
danger in this battle and it deeply affected her that
she could not share it with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The double battle at Jena and Auerst&auml;dt raged all
day long. On the road the Queen received only
uncertain news, sometimes good and sometimes bad.
&ldquo;I have suffered unutterably,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;between
mountains of hope and abysses of despair,
and have learned the meaning of &lsquo;we know not
what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit
itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which
cannot be uttered.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until the fourth day did a messenger sent by
Colonel von Kleist, adjutant of the King, overtake
her in the neighborhood of Brandenburg. The rider
approached the carriage door and handed the Queen
a letter. She opened it quickly, glanced at it, and
appeared crushed. The letter contained only the
words: &ldquo;The King is alive; the battle is lost.&rdquo;
Tears streamed from her eyes at this terrible news.
The handkerchief, wet with her tears in this hour
of distress, which she gave as a remembrance to the
Prince of Anhalt, her protector, at his request, is still
preserved among the treasures of the royal family,
and is certainly not one of the least valuable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;The King is alive&rdquo;&mdash;but where and how?
Truly the King considered himself fortunate to have
barely escaped being taken prisoner. Napoleon
wrote triumphantly to his consort, the Empress
Josephine, that he had very nearly taken the King.
Although Louise did not know this, she knew that
the battle was lost. Dark pictures of the present
and future haunted her. She knew what it meant
to be vanquished by Napoleon; knew with what
boundless arrogance the heartless conqueror treated
princes and people, and what terms of peace he was
likely to dictate.</p>
<p>The carriage passed rapidly through Potsdam on
its way to Berlin, where the Queen arrived late on
the evening of October 17. Her children were not
there. That morning, Lieutenant von Dorville,
adjutant of Field-marshal von M&ouml;llendorf, whom the
King had despatched to Berlin with the bad news
from the battlefield, had arrived, and the Governor,
Count Von der Schulenburg, had at once ordered
the removal of the royal children to Schwedt-on-the-Oder.
Scarcely had the Queen entered her
home, when, hearing of the arrival of the Lieutenant,
she had him summoned to her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the King?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, Your Majesty,&rdquo; answered
Dorville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is the King not with the army?&rdquo; she asked
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the army!&rdquo; answered Dorville. &ldquo;The
army no longer exists!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>So great had been the confidence of victory that
the news of the defeat was all the more crushing.
Consternation and despair reigned in Berlin. The
Governor sought to quiet the inhabitants by the proclamation:
&ldquo;The King has lost a battle: the first
duty of the citizens is to be calm. I require this
of all our citizens. The King and his brothers are
alive.&rdquo; Such were the men in power at a time
when all the available strength of the people should
have been called forth to enduring devotion and
determined resistance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>After a terrible night, at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning
of October 18 the Queen summoned the court
physician, Dr. Hufeland. He found her in despair,
with eyes swollen with weeping and hair in disorder.
&ldquo;All is lost. I must fly to my children, and you
must go with us,&rdquo; she said as he entered. At ten
o&rsquo;clock the carriage was ready and the Queen drove
to Schwedt, where her children were. The sight of
them renewed and accentuated the mother&rsquo;s distress.
They ran tenderly to meet her at the great staircase
of the castle, but she whom they were accustomed
to see gay and smiling now embraced and greeted
them with the words &ldquo;You see me in tears. I am
weeping for the cruel fate which has befallen us.
The King has been deceived in the ability of his
army and its leaders, and we have been defeated
and must fly!&rdquo; To the tutor of the two elder
children, Delbr&uuml;ck, she said: &ldquo;I see a structure
destroyed in one day, upon whose erection great
men have labored through two centuries. The
Prussian State, Prussian army, and Prussian glory
exist no longer.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ah, my sons,&rdquo; she cried to the
eleven-year-old Fritz and nine-year-old William,
&ldquo;you are already old enough to understand these
trials. In the future, when your mother no longer
lives, recall this unhappy hour and let a tear fall in
remembrance of it, as I now weep for the destruction
of my country. But do not be satisfied with
tears. Act, develop your powers! Perchance the
guardian angel of Prussia will protect you. Then
free your people from the shame, the reproach, and
the humiliation into which it has fallen! Try, like
your great-grandfather, the Great Elector, to reconquer
from the French the darkened fame of your ancestors,
as he revenged the defeat and shame of his
father, against the Swedes at Fehrbellin. Do not be
corrupted by the degeneracy of the times. Become
men and heroes, worthy of the name of princes and
grandsons of the great Frederick. But if you cannot
with all your efforts uplift the down-trodden State,
then seek death as did Prince Louis Ferdinand!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>From Schwedt, the sorrowing but heroic Queen
travelled to Stettin. There, on her own responsibility,
she caused the arrest of the cabinet councillor
Lombard, who had originally been a wig-maker and
was now universally considered a traitor, and who
had fled from Berlin to escape the threatening anger
of the populace. Subsequently the King released
Lombard, but deposed him and never saw him
again. The King had gone from the battlefield to
S&ouml;mmerda, where he collected a few scattered detachments
of troops about him. Learning that the
enemy had already passed round his left flank, he
went on to Magdeburg, accompanied by a squadron
of dragoons, reached Berlin on the eve of October
20, but did not enter the city, and arrived, on the
morning of the same day at the fortress of C&uuml;strin,
where his wife also arrived in the evening at ten
o&rsquo;clock. What a meeting after only a week!</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">

<p class="caption"><i>QUEEN LOUISE and her two sons</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>On the road she had not even been able to
get fresh horses at B&auml;rwalde. Rather than furnish
them the steward had turned them loose. So far
had some of their subjects already fallen from their
allegiance. Bad feeling, cowardice, treachery, and
incompetence had spread since the misfortune at
Jena, through military, official, and citizens&rsquo; circles.
One fortress and one division of troops after another
were needlessly surrendered to the enemy. It became
evident that since the last years of Frederick
the Great social decay had spread, not only in the
army, which was insolently resting on its former
laurels, but in official circles and even in the life of the
people. Of this few had had any inkling, least of all
the thoroughly upright King and the noble Louise.
&ldquo;Disaster had to come, or we should have burst with
pride,&rdquo; acknowledged a Prussian years afterwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>The whole country between the Weser and the
Oder became a prey to the enemy after the reserves
under the Prince of W&uuml;rttemberg had been defeated
and destroyed near Halle. Napoleon arrived in
Potsdam October 24 and made his entry into Berlin
on the twenty-seventh. Here he gave free vent to
his ill-humor. According to him, Queen Louise
and the Prussian nobles were to blame for everything.
&ldquo;I will bring these patricians down to beg
their bread on the streets.&rdquo; He pursued the Queen
with the most violent abuse. He called her the
&ldquo;cause of all the troubles which had befallen Prussia.&rdquo;
He brought contempt upon her by pictures and
writings. Even when, three years later, Major Schill
marched from Berlin with six hundred hussars,
called on the people of Germany to rise for their
liberties, and fell fighting at Stralsund, this also was
attributed to Louise, and Napoleon caused an engraving
to appear in Paris, which represented her in
the uniform of the Schill hussars. The attempt
made by Frederick Staps in Sch&ouml;nbrunn at that
time to assassinate the tyrant, Napoleon declared
was planned in Berlin and Weimar. When a general
doubted this, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Women are
capable of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These unworthy attacks and slanders of course
did not injure her in the eyes of her subjects, as
Napoleon wished. On the contrary, the Queen
grew dearer to every good Prussian because of this
abuse, and many heroic hearts were burning to
avenge her wrongs. These attacks of her ignoble
opponent could not always be kept from the Queen,
and cost her much agitation and many tears. &ldquo;Can
this wicked creature not be content to rob the King
of his State? Must the honor of his wife be sacrificed
also, by this contemptible wretch who spreads
the most shameful lies abroad concerning me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As prospects for a favorable turn of affairs were
very slight, the King thought it advisable to open
peace negotiations. Napoleon already demanded
(October 22), at Wittenberg, that the Elbe should
be the western boundary of Prussia, and that the
King should pay one hundred million francs as war
indemnity; but he was willing to permit him to
keep Magdeburg. These demands appeared too
harsh after but one defeat, and ambassadors were
sent to Napoleon at Berlin to secure more favorable
terms. In the meantime, however, Prince Hohenlohe
had been obliged to lay down his arms, with
twelve thousand men, at Prenzlau. The fortresses
of Erfurt, Spandau, Magdeburg, and others were
surrendered to the enemy by their cowardly commanders
with incredible quickness, and Napoleon
would no longer consider the Wittenberg conditions.
He determined to keep as much territory as possible,
so that he could force the English, as allies of
Prussia, to hand over as many of the conquered
French colonies as possible. He offered an armistice
on condition that the principal fortresses in Silesia
and on the Weichsel should be turned over to him,
that the Prussian army should withdraw to the
northeast corner of the dominion, and the assistance
of Russia be declined. By means of this treaty,
which the plenipotentiaries of the King accepted
November 16 in Charlottenburg, Napoleon would
have had Prussia completely in his power. The
King who had gone with his consort from C&uuml;strin
by way of Graudenz to Osterode, held counsel with
his generals and ministers, most of whom were in
favor of confirming the treaty. Stein, however, persuaded
him to reject it, as it gave no guarantee of
lasting peace and threatened the very existence of
Prussia. At this, Napoleon declared: &ldquo;If the King
will not separate his affairs from Russia, he must take
the consequences of the war. Should we conquer
the Czar, there will no longer be a Prussian King.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Louise took fresh courage from her devotion to
Prussia&rsquo;s honor and favored rejection of the treaty,
in accord with the Minister Stein. She had always
recognized in him one of the bulwarks of Prussia,
and she placed in the King&rsquo;s hands his memorial
on the changes in systems of government. However,
the two men did not understand one another,
and the King, considering him an obstinate, pig-headed
person, gave him permission to resign.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>In political affairs Louise held to the faith which
&ldquo;is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
of things not seen.&rdquo; Her motto was: &ldquo;Only
enduring resistance can save us.&rdquo; But on receiving
news of one disaster after another; seeing nothing
but good fortune attending Napoleon and nothing
but misfortune the Prussians; seeing nothing but
misery, the strong woman had her weak moments,
when doubts tortured her as to whether she had
been right in preaching resistance to the conqueror,
or whether it was not presumptuous rebellion against
the cruel fate which seemed to have overtaken her
house and her country. On the way from Koenigsberg,
at Ortelsburg, December 5, 1806, she wrote in
her journal these verses from Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wilhelm
Meister&rdquo;:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Who never ate his bread in sorrow,</p>
<p class="t">Who never spent the darksome hours</p>
<p class="t0">Weeping and watching for the morrow,</p>
<p class="t">He knows ye not, ye gloomy powers!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;To earth, this weary earth, ye bring us,</p>
<p class="t">To guilt ye let us heedless go,</p>
<p class="t0">Then leave repentance fierce to wring us:</p>
<p class="t">A moment&rsquo;s guilt, an age of woe!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>This was indeed a depth of despair in which the
stars of faith and hope seem to have been extinguished.
But by God&rsquo;s providence she found just
at this time a guide and consoler. This was the
pious Madame von Kr&uuml;dener, who at that period exercised
such a mighty awakening influence, especially
among the higher classes, and also upon the Czar.
Five years before, as wife of the Russian ambassador,
she had seen the Queen in undimmed splendor
at the court of Berlin. Now she no longer found a
gay young princess, but a downcast, unhappy woman,
who gladly accompanied her through the hospitals
of Koenigsberg bringing comfort to the suffering
victims of war. It was under her tutelage that the
Queen devoted herself more and more earnestly to
religion and the study of the Bible. Louise wrote
to her later: &ldquo;I owe you a confidence which I am
sure you will receive with tears of joy. Your
earnest conversation, our talks on religion and
Christianity, have left the deepest impression upon
me. I have been pondering more earnestly on these
things, whose existence and value I certainly felt before,
but suspected rather than appreciated. They
have been of great solace to me. I drew nearer to
God, my faith has strengthened, and so, in the midst
of misfortune and numberless insults and injustices,
I have never been without fortitude or wholly unhappy.
It is surely the mercy of the God of love,
which has never allowed my heart to become
hardened or permitted me to lose my love and sympathy
for my fellow men or the desire to serve and
help them. I have seen the vanity of earthly greatness,
and its poverty compared with heavenly
treasures. Yes! I have attained a quietness of
soul and an inner peace, which leads me to hope
that I may be enabled to bear with the composure
and humility of a true Christian all that God in His
providence may send for my purification. From
this standpoint I regard all the temptations which
beset us here below.&rdquo; Thus she found at last sure
hope, though her ship of life and her heart were to
ride stormy seas of trouble, and she was often fain
to cry out with Peter: &ldquo;Lord, save me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Under the stress of this time of anxiety her health
began to suffer. In Koenigsberg she was stricken
with typhoid fever. Her youngest son, Prince
Karl, had first succumbed to it. The court physician,
Dr. Hufeland, who was called from Danzig to
Koenigsberg, tells us:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never shall I forget the night of December 22,
1806, when the Queen&rsquo;s life was in mortal danger.
I sat watching by her bedside, and a terrible storm
was raging that blew down one of the gables of the
old castle where she lay. But here, as in the case of
Prince Karl, through God&rsquo;s blessing the treatment
was successful, and she began to mend. But
suddenly the news came that the French were
approaching. She declared emphatically: &lsquo;I would
rather be in the hands of God than of these creatures.&rsquo;
During a terrible snowstorm and intensely
cold weather (January 3, 1807) she was placed in a
carriage and taken twenty miles across the marshes
of Courland to Memel. We passed three days and
three nights, travelling during the days, partly
through the surf and partly over the ice, and passing
the nights in the most miserable shelters. The
first night the Queen lay in a room where the windows
were broken, and the snow drifted across her
bed. She had no refreshing food. Never has a
queen known such hardships. I watched her in
constant anxiety, fearing hemorrhages. Her courage
never wavered nor her trust in God, and this
encouraged us all. Even the fresh air seemed to be
restorative; instead of becoming worse, she improved
on this terrible journey. At last we espied
Memel on the opposite shore. For the first time
the sun burst forth and mildly illuminated the city,
which was to be our goal and resting-place. We
accepted this as a good omen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>The King and the two children also came soon
afterwards to this town, two miles distant from the
Russian border. The inhabitants gave the royal
pair the most touching proofs of their sympathy
and loyalty.</p>
<p>The King had gradually gathered together an
army of 40,000 men; and they were now joined by
60,000 Russians under General Bennigsen. The
new campaign was begun December 26. There
was a fresh gleam of hope when, in the bloody battle
at Eylau (February 7-8, 1807), the remains of
the Prussian army with the Russians fought so
heroically against Napoleon that five days after the
battle he offered the King a favorable peace if he
would desert Russia. But the honorable man kept
faith with the Czar, who had come to Memel with
reinforcements, and answered in the negative.
Louise, filled with fresh hopes, went back to Koenigsberg
with her husband.</p>
<p>On the way, one morning a peasant and his wife presented
themselves before the royal pair. She brought
the Queen several pounds of fresh butter wrapped in
cabbage-leaves. She thought, she said, that supplies
might be rather low, and would the Queen accept
a few pieces of perfectly fresh snow butter from a
poor peasant. Louise took the gift with hearty
thanks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>But the King interrupted with: &ldquo;Aha! I see
you have brought me the cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the peasant answered: &ldquo;No! we Mennonites
have learned that Your Majesty&rsquo;s war-chest has a
hole in it, and you must have lost your small
change. So we have been looking into our savings-boxes
and each has contributed to a present for
our poor, gracious King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not poor,&rdquo; cried the King; &ldquo;not so
long as I have such subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greatly to his astonishment he saw the peasant pour
out two thousand bright gold pieces. He accepted
them gratefully, and afterwards, when the peasant was
in need, he paid them all back again with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>In Koenigsberg Louise lived in a modest dwelling
and devoted herself to charity. She cared for
the wounded and assisted the destitute. She visited
no theatres, concerts, or balls, but assiduously
attended the church of the gifted preacher, the
evangelical Bishop Borowsky. The letters which
she wrote at the time to her father, Duke of Mecklenburg,
show us her inmost heart. One of
them, written in the Spring of 1807, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Father</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The departure of General Bl&uuml;cher gives me a safe opportunity
of writing frankly to you. Ah! how long I
have been deprived of that pleasure and how much I have
to say to you! Until the third week of my illness, each
day was marked by a fresh misfortune. The despatch of
the excellent Bl&uuml;cher to Pomerania, the patriotism which
animates every one,&mdash;of which the reserve battalions, the
first that have been organized in months, are a proof,&mdash;all
this gives me fresh hope. Some of these reserves are
moving to the front, and some have already fought well.
Yes, dear father, I am convinced that all will yet be well,
and that we shall meet happily once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The siege of Danzig is progressing satisfactorily; the
inhabitants make the soldiers&rsquo; burden easier by providing
them with meat and wine in abundance. They will not
hear of giving up. They would rather be buried in the
ruins of their city than turn traitors to the King. Kolberg
and Graudenz are of the same mind. Had it only been thus
with all the fortresses!&mdash;But enough of past evils. Let
us turn our eyes to God, to Him who guides our destinies,
who never forsakes us when we do not forsake Him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The King is with the Czar and the army. He will remain
there as long as the Czar does. This splendid unanimity,
founded on unshakable steadfastness in misfortune, gives
the best promise of endurance. Surely, by perseverance we
must conquer sooner or later; of that I am firmly convinced.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>It proved to be so, but this long-deferred hope
was not to be realized during Louise&rsquo;s lifetime and
not until the Prussian people had made ample penance.
On May 24 Danzig was taken by the
French after a brave defence under General Kalkreuth.
After several engagements Napoleon was
victorious over Prussians and Russians in the battle
of Friedland, in consequence of which, Koenigsberg
and the country as far as the Niemen was occupied
by him. Louise, then in Memel, writes to her
father, June 17:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;With profound emotion and tears of grateful tenderness
I read your letter of April last. How can I thank
you, best and tenderest of fathers, for the many proofs of
your love, your favor, and indescribable goodness! What a
comfort this is in my trouble, and what a support! When
one is so loved, one cannot be wholly unhappy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another terrible disaster has now overtaken us, and we
are on the point of leaving the kingdom. Imagine what
my feelings are! But I pray you, do not mistake your
daughter. Do not think that my head is bowed in cowardice.
I am upheld by two thoughts. The first is that we
are not the victims of blind chance, but that we are in
God&rsquo;s hands, and that He is directing us; the second, that
we fall with honor. The King has given proof to the
world that he desires honor, not disgrace. Prussia would
not bear the chains of slavery willingly. The King could
not have acted otherwise in a single point without being
untrue to himself and a traitor to his people. What a
solace this is, no one who has not a true feeling of honor
can imagine. But to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In consequence of the unfortunate battle of Friedland,
Koenigsberg fell into French hands. We are pressed by
the enemy, and if the danger becomes greater, I shall be
obliged to leave Memel with my children. The King will
again join the Czar. As soon as the danger becomes
imminent I shall go to Riga. God help me at the moment
that I have to abandon my country. That will require
courage, but I shall look upward, from whence come all
good and evil; and my firm belief is, that He will not
send more than we are able to bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, dear father, I repeat, we go down to defeat
in honor, respected by the nations; and we shall always
retain friends, because we have deserved them. I cannot
tell you how comforting this thought is. I bear all this
with a quietness and composure that can only come from
a clear conscience and pure faith. Therefore be assured,
dear father, that we can never be wholly unhappy and that
many who are clothed with power and good fortune are
not so content as we. God gives peace to the just, and
we may always have reason for joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me assure you for your comfort, that nothing will
be done by us that is not consistent with strictest honor or
with our actions in the past. Rest assured of this, and I
know it will be a comfort to you, as to all who belong to
me. I am always your faithful, obedient, loving daughter
and&mdash;thank God that I can say it as your favor assures
me of it&mdash;your affectionate friend.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Louise</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>On June 24 she writes again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My letters are still here, as wind and storms have prevented
all vessels from leaving port. Now, I shall provide
a reliable messenger and continue to send you news from
here. The army has been obliged to retreat farther and
farther, and on the twenty-first an armistice of four weeks
was arranged by the Russians. The sky often clears when
one expects only cloudy weather; it may be so now. No
one longs for it more than I, but wishes are only wishes
and not realities. Everything comes from above, Thou
merciful Heavenly Father!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith shall not waver, but I can hope no more.
I refer again to my letter, which was written from the
depths of my soul. You will understand me thoroughly
when you have read it, dear father. I will live and die in
honor and even eat bread and salt, if it must be. I shall
never be totally unhappy; only I can hope no more. One
who has been overwhelmed as I have been, can have no
more hope. Should good fortune come, oh! no human
being could be more grateful than I should be; but I no
longer expect it. If misfortune come, it may surprise me
for the moment, but it cannot overwhelm me, if it is undeserved.
Only wrongdoing on our part would bring me
to the grave, and to that we shall not come, for we are
above it. You see, dear father, the enemy of mankind has
no power over me. The King has been with the Czar
since the nineteenth; and since yesterday they have been in
Tauroggen, only a few miles from Tilsit where the French
Emperor is.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;I am at your feet, devotedly yours,</span></p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Louise</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise and Napoleon</span></h2>
<p>An armistice with Russia was concluded by
Napoleon June 21, and on the twenty-fifth
of June one was arranged with Prussia
also, at Tilsit. The next day an
interview took place between the Czar and Napoleon,
at which the King of Prussia was present. Napoleon&rsquo;s
egotism and haughtiness clashed continually
with Frederick William&rsquo;s directness and honesty.
The King met the insolent victor with a noble pride
and bore his misfortunes with a dignity which seemed
to increase the enmity of the French Emperor.
Upon this occasion Alexander conceived the unfortunate
idea that the presence of the Queen might
facilitate the deliberations and that her graciousness
and the nobility of her character would soften the stern
purpose of the conqueror. Alexander urged the
King to summon his wife to Piktupp&ouml;nen, a village
east of Tilsit, where he returned each evening from
the conferences. The King was finally persuaded,
and wrote to his wife of the mission proposed for
her. He withheld his own judgment and wishes,
however, and allowed her to decide the matter entirely
for herself. The Queen received the letter
while sitting with a circle of intimate women friends,
glanced at it hastily, and silently left the room. An
hour later she reappeared with a tear-stained face and
told the company the contents of the letter. Some
of those present advised against the action as undignified
and useless. But she explained: &ldquo;If there is
any one who believes that I can save even one village
more to the fatherland by this step, I am in duty
bound to test that belief. If I must take this painful
step, however, I do not wish to do it unprepared;
I must know just what to say and what to demand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>Hufeland tells us that the Queen was beside herself
at the thought of meeting the slanderer and defamer,
and said: &ldquo;This is the most cruel sacrifice
that I have yet made for my people, and only the
hope of being useful to them makes it possible for
me.&rdquo; She wrote in her journal in regard to it:
&ldquo;God knows what a struggle it costs me! For
though I do not hate the man, I regard him as the
author of the misfortunes of the King and our country.
I admire his talents, but I cannot admire his
character, which is evidently false and deceitful. It
will be very difficult for me to be polite and agreeable
to him. But this hard task is demanded of
me, and I am already used to sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>She left Memel and arrived on the evening of
July 4 at Piktupp&ouml;nen. Here she received her
instructions from Minister Hardenberg as to what
she was principally to dwell upon in the interview.
On July 5 she received a visit from the Czar, and
on the sixth Napoleon sent her greeting through
General Caulaincourt, and an invitation to dinner.
With a French guard of honor she drove in a state
carriage with eight horses to Tilsit,&mdash;and stopped
at the house where her husband lodged. An hour
after her arrival Napoleon, mounted on a white
Arabian horse and accompanied by a large escort,
rode to her door. The King and the princes received
him at the staircase. Napoleon, holding his
riding-whip in his hand, took off his hat, bowed
quickly right and left, and ascended the steps to
the Queen&rsquo;s room, into which the King led him and
then left him alone with her. After the first painful
moments, the Queen expressed her concern that
he had been obliged to climb such a wretched stairway
to visit her. Napoleon answered gallantly:
&ldquo;On the road to such a goal, one should fear no
obstacles.&rdquo; She inquired how the northern climate
agreed with him. And then she turned the conversation
to the negotiations and told him that she
had come to try to persuade him to make reasonable
terms of peace. And when he loftily inquired:
&ldquo;But how could you go to war with me?&rdquo; she
answered, &ldquo;Sire, if we deceived ourselves, it was
but a natural consequence of the fame of the great
Frederick.&rdquo; This reply was overheard by the celebrated
Talleyrand, Napoleon&rsquo;s clever minister. He
is said to have warned Napoleon of the impression
the Queen might make upon him, in these words:
&ldquo;Sire! shall posterity be able to say that a beautiful
queen has caused you to forego the full results of
your greatest victory?&rdquo; But Napoleon scarcely
needed any such warning from Satan, he was Satanic
enough himself. After the Queen&rsquo;s remark he led
the conversation to indifferent subjects, asked about
the material of her dress, etc. But Louise would
not be turned from her purpose. With warmth
and even with tears in her eyes she pleaded with
him not to impose upon the country this unreasonable
burden of a half billion francs for war indemnity
and the numerous garrisons, and especially to
promise her that Danzig and Magdeburg should
remain Prussian. &ldquo;I will think it over,&rdquo; he answered,
holding out a prospect of an acceptable peace.
The conversation lasted a quarter of an hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>At noon the King and Queen dined with the
Emperor of the French; she at his right next to
the Czar and the King at his left. Napoleon was
very amiable. He was good-humored and talkative,
and joked about the danger she had run the previous
autumn, when at the King&rsquo;s headquarters, of
being taken prisoner by his hussars. The conversation
turned on the cession of the provinces, which
Napoleon thought the King ought not to take so
much to heart. The King replied: &ldquo;You do not
know how painful it is to lose inherited lands in
which the dearest memories of childhood are rooted,
and which one can as little forget, as he can his
cradle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His cradle,&rdquo; sneered Napoleon, &ldquo;when the
child has become a man he no longer has time to
think of his cradle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! yes,&rdquo; answered the King, &ldquo;one can no
more forget his youth than he can deny it, and a
man of sentiment will always think with gratitude
of the cradle where he lay as a child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="872" />
<p class="caption"><i>NAPOLEON BONAPARTE</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>The Queen sought to give the conversation another
direction by saying: &ldquo;The mother&rsquo;s heart is
the only cradle which one never forgets.&rdquo; She had
in mind the respect which Napoleon felt for his
own mother, and pointedly inquired about the
health of &ldquo;Madame Bonaparte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening the Queen drove back to the
village. On July 7 she again received an invitation
to dine with Napoleon, but before leaving for Tilsit,
she received a letter from the King with the news
that the conditions of peace were merciless. Therefore
all hopes of the Queen&rsquo;s success vanished, and
this second journey to Tilsit was an almost intolerable
martyrdom. Exciting discussions took place,
and neither the King nor the Queen concealed their
feelings and opinions. As she took her leave
Napoleon picked a magnificent rose from the vine
at the window and offered it to her. Louise was
about to refuse it, but quickly recovering herself, she
took it with the words: &ldquo;At least with Magdeburg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which Napoleon answered dryly: &ldquo;Your
Majesty will kindly remember that it is I who offer,
and you who accept.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>As she threw herself weeping bitterly against the
cushions of her carriage, she sighed and, pointing to
the house, exclaimed: &ldquo;In that place I have been
horribly circumvented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Napoleon wrote on July eighth to his Consort
Josephine: &ldquo;The Queen of Prussia is really
a charming woman; she is very amiable to me, but
you need not be jealous. I am like an oil-cloth,
over which such things slide without touching the
inside. To play the gallant on such occasions does
not cost much.&rdquo; While a prisoner at St. Helena
he wrote: &ldquo;She was perfectly unaffected in her
conversation, and remained mistress of it in spite of
all the dexterity which I employed and all the
trouble which I took. She always returned to her
subject, and always with so much tact and delicacy
that it was impossible to take offence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>A year after this fruitless sacrifice Louise wrote
to a friend:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I suffer unutterably. Reproaches are heaped upon me
over and over again. What can I answer? I sigh and
swallow my tears. A year ago yesterday I had my last interview
with Napoleon. Ah! what a recollection! How
I suffered, suffered more for others than for myself! I wept
and pleaded in the name of love and humanity, in the name
of our misfortunes and the laws that govern the world.
And I was only a woman&mdash;a weak creature, and yet superior
to this adversary, so cold and heartless. The King
is still greater than his enemy, even though his kingdom
has been diminished one-half. He only treated with the
wicked one under pressure of necessity and will not enter
into an alliance with him. That this will sometime prove
to be a blessing to Prussia is my firm belief.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With such lofty sentiments this deeply wounded
woman was able benignly to forgive the man who
was to her the incarnation of evil, the boundless
suffering which he had caused to her, to her family,
and to her people. She was too noble to share the
petty hatred of Napoleon shown by weaker natures.
In former days, when every one belonging to the court
joined in scorning the &ldquo;upstart,&rdquo; she kept silence.
Shortly before her last illness, one day when her
sorrowful glance fell upon the portrait of the Emperor,
a titled lady in her company passionately denounced
the oppressor. The Queen quickly turned
and rebuked the outbreak with a gentle look and
word: &ldquo;If I have forgiven him the injuries he has
done me, what reason have you not to forgive him?&rdquo;
And with a gesture of her hand, as though in
blessing to her great enemy, she left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The Tilsit peace, concluded on the night of July
9-10 was more detrimental to Prussia than the
previous war had been. The fortresses of Stettin,
C&uuml;strin, and Glogau remained in the hands of the
conqueror as pledges for the war indemnity. This
indemnity, which included the support of forty
thousand French troops and all sorts of unreasonable
extortions, amounting, at the end of the year 1808,
to at least six hundred million francs, was ruthlessly
exacted from a poor land already robbed of its
richest territories. Agriculture and art life were
crippled, commerce restricted, and the country
impoverished.</p>
<p>Though the King and his people tried conscientiously
to meet all these oppressive demands, Napoleon
purposely delayed the evacuation of the country,
paid no attention to representations made him,
treated the Prussian ambassador like a servant, and
kept faith with nobody. &ldquo;Is it not enough to
make one despair?&rdquo; asked Louise in a letter. &ldquo;Ah!
my God, why hast Thou forsaken us?&rdquo; Her last
comforter on earth was Stein, who, with his &ldquo;great
heart and comprehensive mind,&rdquo; she hoped might
still find a way out of this misery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>The Queen, supported by the King&rsquo;s brothers and
the patriotic Princess Louise Radziwill, a sister of
Prince Louis Ferdinand, undertook to persuade
the King that Stein was the only saviour in this time
of need; and begged him to recall to the head of
the ministry the man who had once been dismissed
in disfavor. The King agreed; and Stein, generously
forgetting the injustice which had been done him,
accepted. He arrived in Memel, September 30,
1807, and was at once placed at the head of the
government by the King. But he encountered a
strong party bent upon deposing him and which put
many obstacles in his way. Louise wrote to him at
that time: &ldquo;I entreat you to be patient during
these first months, so that we shall have nothing to
regret, and all shall not be lost. I implore you to
consider this for the sake of the King, the country,
my children, and myself. Patience!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the commission appointed to fix the war
indemnity finished its work. The poor, depleted
country was really to pay &ldquo;only&rdquo; one hundred and
fifty-four million francs, and until this was accomplished,
it must maintain a French army and allow
the taxes to be collected by the French in the provinces
occupied by them! Even Stein, when he
heard of these terrible demands, was turned to stone.
This new and dreadful calamity was a crushing blow
for a weak woman. It is no wonder that she wrote
in October, 1807:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Even I am losing my fortitude. It is terribly hard,
especially as it is undeserved. My future is very sad. If
we may only keep Berlin; but sometimes I have an awful
presentiment that he will take it from us also and make it
the capital of another kingdom. In that event I have only
one wish&mdash;to emigrate to some distant land and to live a
private life and forget&mdash;if possible. Alas! poor Prussia!
Deserted through weakness, persecuted by insolence, depleted
by misfortune, we must perish. Savary, the French
ambassador, has assured us that Russia&rsquo;s intervention would
not help us, and he has advised us to sell our jewels and
valuables. Think of his daring to say this!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mockery of this advice wounded Louise,
who was already accustomed to privations and self-denial.
During her stay in Memel money was
often lacking for daily expenses. At that time
many citizens fared more sumptuously than the
royal family. The King sent his golden dinner
service to the mint to be turned into money to
lighten the burden of his oppressed subjects. Only
a single golden plate remained of all the inherited
antique treasures. The princes and princesses also
renounced a third of their yearly incomes. It was
at that time that the hard-pressed King sent his
eldest daughter, afterwards Empress of Russia, a
five-thaler note for a new dress, adding that she
must make that do, as it was all he could spare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>Napoleon had been unyielding. Even the mission
of Prince William to Paris was in vain. They were
obliged to resign themselves to the demands of the
conqueror. Stein signed a treaty September 3, 1808,
in Berlin, by which it was finally agreed that Prussia
was to pay one hundred and forty million francs. The
fortresses of Glogau, Stettin, and C&uuml;strin were to be
held by the French until the debt was fully extinguished.
Until the first hundred million francs were
paid the taxes were to be collected by the French and
the country was to be under their regime, and during
ten years the Prussians were to keep only 42,000
men under arms. It was now necessary to raise
great sums of money as quickly as possible. By
alienation of royal domains and strictest economy in
all branches of government, a large amount was at
last collected, and by the payment of this and by
giving mortgage deeds, at last, at the end of the
year 1808, the French (who continually sought to
put obstacles in their way) were induced to evacuate
the country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise&rsquo;s Probation</span></h2>
<p>As soon as the country between Memel and
the Weichsel was evacuated the royal
family removed to Koenigsberg, January
15, 1808. It was none too soon, for
Louise&rsquo;s health had suffered seriously in the cold,
damp climate of Memel. In Koenigsberg she
gave birth to a daughter, February 1, who was
christened with the name of Louise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>In May the royal family moved to the quiet,
simple country-seat, which still goes by the name of
the Queen. Encouraged by the Koenigsberg professor
S&uuml;vern, she devoted herself while there to the
study of the history of Europe and tried &ldquo;to live
in the past, as the future held nothing for her.&rdquo;
The ancient history of Germany was particularly
comforting to her. The motto of pious knightly
times: &ldquo;Justice, Faith, Love,&rdquo; pleased her so well
that she had a seal made bearing the device. But
she said that if she were to choose a motto for
herself, it would be: &ldquo;God is my refuge.&rdquo; Her soul
was filled with a new hope, as she saw the perishing
faith in God&rsquo;s power and dominion reviving amid
the fiery trials of the time, and felt that the German
and Prussian peoples would awake, abandon foreign
immorality, and arise in their might to shake off
foreign domination. At that time a new light had
arisen in Switzerland, a man who was dedicating his
life and means to the better education of the masses,
from a religious and humanitarian standpoint. This
was the noble Pestalozzi, who had evolved a new
system of education and written books of instruction
for the people, particularly for mothers.
Louise read the tale of &ldquo;Poor Leonard and his
Noble Gertrude&rdquo; with great emotion and found in
it a passage that particularly appealed to her:
&ldquo;Misery and suffering are God&rsquo;s blessings, when
they are patiently endured.&rdquo; Pestalozzi and his
followers hoped everything from a more natural
system of education and the thorough religious
training of youth. The Queen firmly believed in
him and awaited with impatience the arrival of his
pupil Zeller, from W&uuml;rtemberg, whom the King
had summoned to introduce the new Swiss system
of education into Prussia. Louise took great
pleasure in visiting his school and educational institute,
and contributed to its success by every means
in her power.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>It was at that time that she wrote this splendid
letter to her father, which gives us such a charming
glimpse not only into her matured and disciplined
mind, but also into her happy family life. The
beginning is sad. She judges and foresees like a
prophetess, then she rejoices as only a happy wife
and mother can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All is over for us, if not forever, at least for the present.
For myself I have no more hopes. I have become
resigned, and in this resignation to the will of Heaven, I
am composed and happy, if not with an earthly happiness,
at least with what means much more, a spiritual happiness.
I see ever more clearly that all had to come as it has come.
God&rsquo;s providence works silently toward new conditions and
I feel that there is to be a new order of things, for the old
has outlived itself and is doomed to decay. We had fallen
asleep on the laurels of Frederick the Great, who, as master
of his century, created a new era. We did not advance with
it and so it has left us behind. We can learn a great deal
from Napoleon, and what he has accomplished will not be
lost. It would be blasphemy to say that God is with him;
but evidently he is a tool in the hand of the Almighty
employed to bury the dead past. The world will certainly
progress, faith in the Perfect One is promise of that. But
the world can only grow better through the good. Therefore
I do not believe that the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte
is firmly seated on his now brilliant throne. Men of truth
and justice alone are secure, and he is only politic and crafty.
He does not conform to eternal laws, but only to circumstances
as he finds them. He besmirches his reign with
many injustices. He is not honest with the world and not
true to himself. His unbounded ambition concerns only
himself and his personal interests. He is blinded by his
own good fortune and believes that he is capable of all
things. Withal, he is without moderation; and he who
cannot be temperate is sure to fall sooner or later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe firmly in God, and therefore in a moral order.
I do not see this in the rule of the strongest: therefore I
live in hopes that better times will come. It is plain that
all that has happened and is now happening is but the preparation
for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s good purpose, and
not the end, as it shall be in perfection. We shall probably
not see this end, but die on the road thither. But God&rsquo;s
will be done in everything. In this hope which lives in
the depths of my soul I find comfort, strength, courage, and
joy. Truly, everything in this world is in transition! We
must learn our lesson, and our only care should be to become
better and wiser with each day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, dear father, that you have a pious and resigned
daughter even in adversity, and that the principles of Christian
piety which I owe to your instruction and your good example
have borne good fruit and will as long as I draw breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be glad to hear, dear father, that the misfortune
which has overtaken us has not affected our family
life at all; indeed, it has strengthened the bonds and made
them all the more precious. The King, who is the best
of men, is kinder and more loving than ever. He is still
the lover and bridegroom. His deeds, more than his words,
show how attentive and full of care for me he is. Yesterday
he said to me so sweetly and simply: &lsquo;Dear Louise,
you have become more precious and dear to me in our misfortunes,
as I see more and more what a treasure I have in
you. Let storms rage outside if bright weather can only
prevail in our married life. I have named our youngest
daughter Louise because of my love for you. May she
become a second Louise.&rsquo; His goodness moved me to
tears. It is my pride, my joy, and my happiness that I
possess the love and respect of the best of husbands, and
because I love him and we are so in accord, that the will
of the one is also the will of the other. It will be easy for
me to preserve this happy understanding, which grows more
perfect as the years pass. In a word, he loves me and I
love him, and we are happiest when we are together. Forgive
me, dear father, if I say this rather boastfully. I should
not care to speak of it to others; and this also I have learned
from the King. It is enough that we know it ourselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our children are our treasures, and we look upon
them with confidence and hope. The Crown-prince [later
Frederick William the Fourth] is full of life and spirit.
Our son William [the German Emperor], if I do not deceive
myself, will be like his father, simple, sensible, and
reliable. He resembles his father most, but will not be so
handsome, I think. You see, dear father, I am still in love
with my husband.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After picturing in the same graphic manner her
son Carl and the daughters Charlotte and Alexandrine,
the happy mother continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to be said yet about little Louise.
May she become like her ancestress, the amiable and pious
Louise of Orange, the worthy consort of the Great Elector.
Now I have shown you my whole gallery, beloved father.
You will say, this is a mother who is in love with her children
and can see only the good. But really I do not see
any bad tendencies in any of them. They have their faults
like other children, but these disappear in time as they grow
older. Circumstances and conditions discipline people, and
it may be well for our children that they have become acquainted
in their youth with the serious side of life. Had
they grown up in the lap of luxury and in comfort, they
would have thought that it must always be so. But now
they perceive that there is another side to life in the grave
face of their father and the frequent tears and sadness of their
mother. My whole care is devoted to my children, and I
ask God daily in my prayers to bless them and not to take
his Holy Spirit from them. If God preserves them to me,
he gives me my richest treasure, which no one can take
from me. Come what may, united with our good children
we shall be happy. I am and remain always your grateful
daughter,</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Louise</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Thus, happy with her husband and children, communing
with God and occupied with the future of
her people, Louise lived a blessed life in her family
circle, though the little country house was hardly
large enough to accommodate them, and in spite of
the hardships of the time. &ldquo;I have good books, a
good conscience, a good piano, and so can live more
peacefully among the storms of the world than those
who cause these storms,&rdquo; she wrote to a friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Napoleon had just raised a fresh storm by crushing
Spain, as he had crushed Prussia. But this
time it was a revolution of the people, a prophecy of
the storm which was to arise five years later against
the tyrant in enslaved Germany. In the dethronement
of the King of Spain at a time of peace, in order
to put his brother Joseph on the throne, Louise
recognized fresh evidence of the iron hand which
rested so heavily on the bowed brow of Europe, and
also a warning for Prussia.  &ldquo;What have we to
expect in our situation?&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;Ah, my
God! will the time come when the hand of fate
shall at last write &lsquo;Mene, mene, tekel&rsquo; on these
walls? I do not complain, however, that my lot
has been cast in this unhappy period. I have
borne children who will perhaps contribute to the
good of humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Napoleon had been holding the
fate of Prussia cruelly in the balance, until in September,
1808, the country, with the exception of the
three fortresses on the Oder, was at last evacuated
by the French tormentors. Napoleon now wished
to have the royal family again in Berlin, &ldquo;as in a
mousetrap,&rdquo; surrounded by the armies of France
and of the Rhenish Confederation. Instead of immediately
returning thither, they gladly accepted an
invitation from Czar Alexander to visit St. Petersburg,
December 27. On the journey the King and
Queen were shown at Riga the house of the order,
founded in 1390, &ldquo;guild of the blockheads,&rdquo; whose
members were obliged to take an oath never to
marry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The King remarked to Louise: &ldquo;Had I belonged
to that guild you would have been spared
many unhappy experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had they been ten times worse, and had you
been able to foretell all our misfortunes, I should
not have allowed you to become a master of this
guild,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>The royal pair were greeted with all honors and
pomp, both on the journey and in St. Petersburg.
The French ambassador also <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> them at a grand
banquet. But Louise was depressed rather than
elated by all this pomp and ceremony. A deep
melancholy possessed her in the midst of these
splendors. Added to this, she fell ill at an evening
exhibition of fireworks, which ended with a shower
of thirty-four thousand rockets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>On January 31, the King and Queen returned to
Koenigsberg. &ldquo;I come as I went; nothing dazzles
me now,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;My kingdom is not of
this world.&rdquo; Two days after her thirty-third birthday
(1809) she wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This has been another day when I have felt the burden
of the world with all its sins. I am sick and I believe that
as long as things remain in their present condition, I shall
not get well. [It was dreadful to her that war had broken
out again between France and Austria, and in the end Russia
and Prussia would be forced to take the field against Austria.]
My birthday was a terrible day to me. In the evening there
was a brilliant celebration given by the city in my honor,
preceded by a rich, gay banquet at the castle. How sad it
all made me! My heart was torn. I danced! I smiled and
said pleasant things to the hosts, was friendly to every one,
but could scarcely endure my misery. To whom will
Prussia belong a year hence? Whither shall we all be
scattered? God, Almighty Father, take pity on us!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the new campaign against Austria, Napoleon
arrived before Vienna, May 10. After overthrowing
the brave army led so gallantly by Archduke Carl,
in the battle of Wagram (July 5-6, 1809), he dictated
the humiliating peace treaty at Sch&ouml;nbrunn on
October 14, which made the return of the royal family
to Berlin impossible. Therefore Louise passed
another summer with her family at the country-seat
near Koenigsberg. Her health grew worse, and
an intermittent fever depleted her system. Austria&rsquo;s
new misfortune, which completed the enslavement
of Germany, increased her illness.&mdash;&ldquo;God knows
where I may be buried&mdash;scarcely in Prussian soil!
Austria is singing her swan song and then adieu,
Germania!&rdquo; she wrote in her journal, fearing the utmost
from Napoleon&rsquo;s anger and greed and no longer
believing there was any future for them on earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, she devoted herself
zealously, as far as her strength allowed her to do
so, to the schools of the adjacent metropolis of
Koenigsberg, as the nurseries of a better future.
She was especially interested in the &ldquo;model institute&rdquo;
installed in the orphans&rsquo; home by School-director
Zeller. She studied detailed reports and
took a lively interest in all that pertained to the
moral elevation of the people. She clearly perceived
that this would cost great sacrifices. To her
sorrow she realized that neither reason nor justice,
morality nor piety had been awakened by the misfortunes
which had overtaken Prussia. She wrote
to a friend: &ldquo;Our natures are too hardened through
selfishness and false education for them to be easily
shaken or disciplined. Only great revolutions can
and will accomplish this.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>She watched with great interest during this cruel
and sorrowful time, the revolt of the people of the
Tyrol under the leadership of the heroic, simple,
and pious Andreas Hofer, innkeper of Passeyr,
against the foreigners. &ldquo;Hofer!&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;what
a man! This Hofer, a peasant, becomes a field-marshal,
and what an able one! His weapons,
prayer; his ally, God! He fights with folded
hands and bent knee, and slays as with the flaming
sword of the cherubim!&rdquo; How she must have
mourned over the fallen hero, when, betrayed by a
countryman, he was taken prisoner by the French
and shot on the walls of the fortress at Mantua,
February 20, 1810!</p>
<p>At the beginning of September Louise had to
be taken back to the city castle as the result
of a relapse. In those days of suffering she
found a comforter in the excellent, liberal-minded
Pastor Borowsky. Once, when the King was looking
dejectedly into the future, he took him by the
button of his uniform and frankly said to him:
&ldquo;Your Majesty must learn faith!&rdquo; Borowsky
describes the Queen thus:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;She is not joyful in this time of trial; but her earnestness
is full of quiet cheer, and the insight and composure
which God has given her lends to her personality a
charm and dignity. Her eyes have indeed lost their former
brilliancy, and one can tell that she has wept much and
still weeps; but they have gained an expression of sadness
and quiet longing which is more beautiful than the mere
zest of life. The roses on her cheeks have faded, and a
delicate pallor has taken their place; but it is still a beautiful
face, and I like the white roses on those cheeks almost
better than the red ones. About her mouth, where formerly
a sweet, happy smile lurked, one sees now and then
a slight trembling of the lips. This shows pain but no
bitterness. Her dress is always extremely simple, and the
choice of colors shows her mood. Last Sunday I found
her alone in the sitting-room, and reading the Holy Book.
She quickly arose, met me kindly, and began at once: &lsquo;I
have now come to feel and appreciate the wonderful one
hundred and twenty-sixth Psalm about which we lately
conversed. The more I ponder it and try to understand it,
the more its grandeur and loveliness attract me. I know
of nothing so elevating and comforting, so deep and so
sweet, as these precious words. It is full of a spirit of
sadness and yet of victory, of resignation and of the most
joyful confidence and trust; it is a hallelujah with tears. I
have read it again and again, until it is graven on my
memory.&rsquo; And then the Queen reverently repeated the
psalm, with a soft, but clear, firm voice, varying it here
and there and applying it to her condition. The tone in
which she recited it betrayed how deeply her richly tuned
nature had made it her own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Louise&rsquo;s youngest son, Albert, was born October
fourth. At the christening the officiating clergyman
spoke of &ldquo;the dedication of the child to life&rdquo;
instead of the reception of this new soul into the
company of God&rsquo;s elect. This shallow and superficial
interpretation, which seemed to Louise like
a profanation of the holy sacrament, grieved her
deeply. Only the certainty consoled her that the
worthiness or the opinions of the officiating clergyman
had nothing to do with the holiness of the
christening and could take nothing from it, for its
power comes from God who instituted it, and not
from weak men who perform it. But these occurrences
gave her an insight into the true causes of
Prussia&rsquo;s downfall. She expressed this in the words:
&ldquo;We have fallen away from the faith; hence our
misfortunes.&rdquo; All the more urgent it seemed to
her that she must never tire in her work, particularly
for the religious elevation of the people. In
this she was in accord with her husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>Freiherr
von Stein, who had been banished by Napoleon, but
whom she considered the &ldquo;foundation stone of justice&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;jewel among the German people,&rdquo; and
had always esteemed so highly because the foundation
of his steadfast political character was a serious
piety and high morality, expressed her sentiments
exactly when he said that &ldquo;it was the highest duty
to foster a moral, religious, and patriotic spirit in
the nation, to infuse fresh courage, self-reliance, and
a feeling of national unity, with a readiness to make
any sacrifice for independence.&rdquo; Thus Louise inspired
all the efforts and the work by means of
which, in the field of religion, of morality, and of
scientific education, the Prussian State was to be
regenerated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Louise&rsquo;s Death</span></h2>
<p>Although life in Koenigsberg and its
environs was peaceful and pleasant, yet
Louise often felt oppressed &ldquo;in this banishment,
this climate of raging storms
more than a hundred miles from her home.&rdquo; A fit
of homesickness for Berlin and her Charlottenburg
seized her. When at last the time of return grew
near, she wept many tears at the thought of finding
all as it had been, and yet so changed. &ldquo;Dark forebodings
trouble me,&rdquo; she admitted, while everywhere
the most gratifying and touching reception was being
prepared for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The King, the Queen, the Princes and Princesses
left Koenigsberg December 15, 1809, and during
the journey, which lasted eight days, were the recipients
of countless proofs of sincere affection from
the populace. In Stargard they met old Nettelbeck
of Kolberg, who had assisted the commandant
Gneisenau so valiantly and successfully in the
defence of this fortress, while other Prussian strongholds
were shamefully capitulating. He was invited
to dinner, and afterward had a long conversation in
the adjoining room with the King and Queen. He
was so affected at the sight of the long-suffering pair
that he cried out: &ldquo;Ah! as I look upon Your
Majesty and my good Queen and think of the misfortunes
which still weigh so heavily upon you, it
seems as though my heart would break.&rdquo; They all
wept, and Nettelbeck, turning to the Queen, said:
&ldquo;May God long preserve you, my good Queen, to
comfort my good King, for without you he could
not have borne his misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>On December 23, 1809, the same day on which,
sixteen years before, she had made her first triumphal
entry into Berlin, she now returned after an
absence of two years and two months. In the
meanwhile Berlin had been treated as the capital of
a French province, and Louise found that her
apartments had been occupied by insolent French
generals. The rejoicings of the inhabitants over the
return of their King and Queen were exuberant.
The Queen with the younger children drove in a
magnificent carriage which the citizens of Berlin
had given her. The King was on horseback; the
Princes Frederick and William followed as officers
of the guard with their regiments. The City Council
hoped that Their Majesties would give the
citizens the pleasure of attending the gala performance
at the theatre in the evening. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
King, &ldquo;the first place I visit in Berlin shall be the
church.&rdquo; Not until the following Monday did he
appear with his family at the opera house, where
they were greeted with great enthusiasm, and many
eyes filled with tears at the sight of the beloved
King and &ldquo;the partner of his sorrows.&rdquo; Many
Prussians vowed, as they saw their Queen again,
that they would not rest until they had caused those
angelic eyes, which had so often filled with tears
over Bonaparte&rsquo;s insults and injuries, to shine with
joy over Prussian victories.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>During the occupation of Berlin by the French,
all mention of the Queen and any celebration in her
honor had been strictly forbidden by the commandant.
Nevertheless, on her birthday, the famous actor
Iffland appeared on the stage at the evening performance
wearing a rose and induced the other actors
to do likewise. The audience immediately guessed
what the roses meant, and cheered the Queen.
Iffland suffered the penalty of a few days&rsquo; arrest
for this. The Queen summoned him to her presence
at the theatre to express her gratitude and appreciation.
Later the King bestowed on him the
order of the Red Eagle. Immediately after her return,
Louise remembered another worthy man, who
had stood for the truth when nearly all were bowing
before the conquerors and allowing the most shameful
scandals against the Queen to be circulated.
Upon a certain occasion the local authorities of Berlin
were being presented to the French Emperor, and he
broke out in abusive complaints against the Queen.
The reverend Dr. Ermann interrupted him abruptly
with the words: &ldquo;Sire, that is not true.&rdquo; The despot
hastily turned to the miscreant who had dared
to tax him with the lie, but when he saw the tall,
venerable figure of the old clergyman and looked
into his earnest face, he remained silent and confused
and said not another word about the Queen. The
King also honored Ermann with an order; but
Louise arose from the dinner-table at which the excellent
man was a guest and went to him, glass in
hand, to greet him, saying: &ldquo;I cannot deny myself
the pleasure of drinking to the knight, who, when
all kept silence, had the courage to break a lance
for the honor of his Queen. Do you still remember
how, on your jubilee, we wished you happiness and
long life? God has heard our prayer and preserved
you, so that there should be at least one courageous
enough to tell Napoleon the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Their terrible enemy continually devised methods
for making life uncomfortable for Louise and her
family, even in Berlin. He insisted upon the payment
of the outstanding war debts more vehemently
than ever, and threatened to occupy the country
once more with an army to collect them. But all
means of help had been exhausted, and it was impossible
to make any new loans. Then Napoleon
intimated to the King that he could wipe out the
debt by ceding the country and its people. Indeed,
Minister Altenstein could see in the relinquishment
of Silesia the only possible way out of their difficulties.
But the King and Queen rejected this idea
with indignation, and the new Minister, Hardenberg,
succeeded in conciliating Napoleon for the time being,
until Prussia had recuperated and liberation was
at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>But Louise was not destined to see this time
of resurrection. She could not rid herself of the
thought that fresh misfortunes awaited her family
and country, and that the King might be taken
from her by some Napoleonic act of violence. On
her birthday she said: &ldquo;I think this is the last
time that I shall celebrate my birthday here.&rdquo; Her
condition became rapidly worse. She suffered from
oppressed breathing and heart attacks, and had
several spells of fever. The anxious physicians
advised her to beware of strong emotions and excitement.
But how in such times could the heart of
a woman so sensitive remain calm and cheerful?
She passed the month of May in Potsdam and was
so much improved by the country sojourn that she
ventured to carry out a long-cherished plan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>She had long wished to visit her beloved father in
Strelitz. She started cheerfully from Charlottenburg,
June 25, 1810, but soon became very serious,
and scarcely knew why she was so downhearted when
she reached the frontiers of Mecklenburg. Did she
have a presentiment of her early death? Certainly
she had said at her last birthday celebration&mdash;&ldquo;I
feel that this will be the last time that I shall have a
birthday.&rdquo; But this fit of sadness passed and she
was filled with joy at the meeting with her dear
father. She found her eighty-year-old grandmother,
the Landgravine of Darmstadt, also at Strelitz.
While there she wished to live only for her own
people, and she attended but one court function, at
which all those present noted an indescribable nobility
and sweetness in her bearing. Her beautiful features
bore the stamp of suffering, and when she raised
her lovely blue eyes toward heaven, her look unconsciously
expressed a longing for the home above.
After the meal, Louise joined the circle of more
intimate friends, and they admired the pearls which
were her only ornaments. She answered: &ldquo;I am
very fond of them and withheld them when I gave
up my jewels. They suit me best for they symbolize
tears, and I have wept so many.&rdquo; When the
King punctually joined her as he had promised, she
cried: &ldquo;Now at last I am perfectly happy.&rdquo; She
immediately seated herself at her father&rsquo;s desk and
wrote in French the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My dear father, to-day I am very happy as your daughter
and as wife of the best of all husbands.</p>
<p><span class="center"><span class="sc">New Strelitz</span>, June 28, 1810.</span></p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Louise.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were the last words she ever wrote.</p>
<p>Late in the evening she drove with the King and
her family out to the country seat of High-Zieritz.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>On alighting she felt ill and was seized with a severe
catarrhal fever. The next day she forced herself to
appear at table and in the garden for tea with the
family. But the next morning the doctor, whom
she had not called, as she was anxious to accompany
her husband to Rhinesberg, found her condition
serious. After being bled, she fainted. Nevertheless
she grew so much better that on July 3 the King,
who was obliged to go to Berlin on important business
of state, left her, hoping to return in a few days
to find her well enough to be taken home. The
illness seemed to lessen during the week. Louise
bore the sleepless nights patiently; she seemed tranquil.
The King, who had himself fallen ill, sent the
Queen&rsquo;s own physician, who found that the greatest
danger was over. But the disease took another bad
turn, though there were times of improvement when
the cough, abated and the patient was able to talk
with her old-time strength and clearness. A letter
from the King affected her so much that she kept it
on her heart, where she could read it again and
again. &ldquo;How happy is she who receives such
letters!&rdquo; she exclaimed several times. She was also
interested in political news and thought continually
of her children.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>On July 13, the birthday of her daughter Charlotte,
she received a letter from her full of tenderness
and longing. Her sister Frederika read it to the
Queen, but was obliged to pause several times and
could not finish it, for the patient was too much
agitated by it. After a few comfortable days, on
July 16 severe heart paroxysms set in, which continued
fully five hours. It was the first struggle
with death. The Duke&rsquo;s physician, Dr. Hieronymi,
found an incurable affection of the heart and prepared
the Queen&rsquo;s father for the worst. Messengers
were sent post-haste to the King in Charlottenburg.
Instead of Dr. Hufeland, who had been called to
Holland, Dr. Heim of Berlin with three other physicians
came. The fever and weakness grew worse.
Louise could scarcely await the coming of the King,
and she was happy when she heard that he would
arrive July 19. She was patient during her terrible
pain and thanked God for every moment of relief,
but the feeling of her infirmity overwhelmed her.
&ldquo;I am a Queen,&rdquo; she said once, &ldquo;but I cannot so
much as move my arm.&rdquo; The coughing spells and
oppression of breathing grew worse during the night,
and Dr. Heim remained at her bedside. About
midnight the patient had a burning thirst, drank
several times, and often exclaimed: &ldquo;Air! air!&rdquo;
A cold perspiration stood in great drops on her
forehead. At two o&rsquo;clock, in one of her painful
moments, she said to the physician: &ldquo;Think of it!
if I should have to die and leave the King and my
children!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>At the break of day, about four o&rsquo;clock, the King
arrived with the two eldest sons. The sky was
overcast. Having been advised of the certainty of
her death the King was completely crushed with
grief. When her grandmother said that with God
nothing is impossible, the bitter words escaped him:
&ldquo;Ah! if she were not mine she would live; but as
she is my wife, she is sure to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he entered her room she said with a feeble
voice: &ldquo;My dear friend, how happy I am to see
you!&rdquo; Though the King made the greatest effort
he could not completely control his grief. &ldquo;Am I
then so dangerously ill?&rdquo; she asked him. After he
had somewhat reassured her, she asked again: &ldquo;Who
came with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fritz and William,&rdquo; answered the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how happy I am!&rdquo; she said, while her hand
trembled in his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will fetch them,&rdquo; he cried, hardly able to
master his feelings. He immediately returned leading
both sons to their mother&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dear Fritz, dear William, are you here?&rdquo;
she said to them. They wept aloud, went out,
and returned when the paroxysm of her pain had
subsided.</p>
<p>In the meantime it had come to be nearly nine
o&rsquo;clock. A new paroxysm came on. &ldquo;Air! air!&rdquo;
gasped the Queen. The doctor came in and tried
to raise her arms, but she was not able to keep them
there, and as they sank she said: &ldquo;Ah, nothing can
help me but death!&rdquo; The King sat beside her and
held her right hand. Her sister, the Princess Solms,
kneeling in front of her, had grasped her left hand.
Her weary head rested on the bosom of her friend
Madame von Berg. At ten minutes before nine,
July 19, 1810, came the last seizure of pain. Louise
bent her head gently back, closed her eyes, and
cried: &ldquo;Lord Jesus, take me quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later she had breathed her life away
in a last deep sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The King had sunk back, but now drew himself
quickly together and, amid kisses and tears, closed
the eyes of his Louise, &ldquo;his life&rsquo;s star, which had
guided him so faithfully our life&rsquo;s dark journey,&rdquo; as
the poet sang. Then he hurried out and brought
his two sons, who, weeping bitterly, kissed the
hands of their departed mother.</p>
<p>The beautiful features of the Queen were not in
the least distorted. Death seemed to glorify her
countenance. Her mouth bore an expression of
victory and peace. The features of &ldquo;the most
beautiful woman in the King&rsquo;s lands&rdquo; have been
preserved by Rauch&rsquo;s master hand in the marble
monument which he was later commissioned to
chisel for her tomb in Charlottenburg.</p>
<p>On July 20 the King left High-Zieritz with his
children, and a week later the Queen&rsquo;s remains were
brought to Berlin. The whole city was in mourning,
not a heart remained untouched; tears flowed, and
even men wept as the funeral procession passed by.
The body lay in state in the castle until the thirtieth.
Then the casket was sealed and laid away
for a time in the cathedral. On December 23 it
was taken to Charlottenburg and placed in the
mausoleum which the King had had built after plans
by the famous architect Schinkel. Over the vault
rises a building in the form of a Greek temple.
The roof of the antechamber is supported by four
granite columns. The light falls from above through
blue glass, which casts a magical light over its
interior. On the memorial tablet the King caused
the simple words to be engraved: &ldquo;According to
God&rsquo;s Will.&rdquo; In the year 1815 the marble figure
of the Queen was placed in the mausoleum. The
transfigured Queen lies on a couch as though in
peaceful slumber. Her head, with its flowing hair
crowned with a diadem, is slightly inclined toward
the right. The beautiful arms, clad in short sleeves,
are lightly crossed below the breast, which the right
hand touches expressively. One foot is crossed
over the other, and the whole beautiful figure is half
revealed by a simple, flowing garment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Louise was lovely in life and her monument
shows her lovely in death. She rests in the
chamber, where trials can no longer touch her, until
on the day of resurrection her decayed body shall
be awakened from the tomb to a more beautiful life.
More enduring even than marble is the memory
which she has left behind in our hearts. She gave
to her people and the whole German fatherland an
example of piety, purity, singleness of heart, and
true, womanly virtues; a model of humility in fortune,
courageous faith in misfortune, of devoted
patriotism, of faithfulness in small things as well as
in great things. Therefore her influence has been
felt, even after the night came, in which no man
can work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The rise of the Prussian people in the great war
for liberation from Italian oppression and craftiness,
was principally inspired by the memory of the never-to-be-forgotten
Queen, &ldquo;who always carried the
banner of hope before us,&rdquo; as the poet Heinrich
von Kleist sung on her last birthday. Her memory
and example inspired a great multitude of women
and girls to sacrifice their gold rings for iron ones,
which bore the inscription: &ldquo;I gave gold for
iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the year 1813, on the birthday anniversary
of the departed, King Frederick William the Third
instituted the highest order of the soldiers of liberty,
&ldquo;the Iron Cross.&rdquo; After the battle of Leipzig
(October 18, 1813) he hurried from the battlefield
to the thanksgiving service in the Berlin cathedral
and then to the mausoleum in Charlottenburg to
place a wreath on the casket of the perfect one.
He founded the Order of Louise, August 3, 1814,
as a decoration for the most zealous among the army
nurses. Since 1840 he has rested beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Her oldest son, King Frederick William the
Fourth, said, in the year 1848: &ldquo;The unity of
Germany is dear to my heart; this idea is an inheritance
from my mother.&rdquo; But her second son,
William, when the nephew of his mother&rsquo;s old arch-enemy
declared war against Germany on the anniversary
of Louise&rsquo;s death, July 19, 1870, knelt at
his mother&rsquo;s coffin in the tomb at Charlottenburg
before he went to meet the enemy, and prayed for
a blessing from above. It accompanied him through
many battles and victories, until he arrived before
the palace at Versailles. He returned to Berlin
March 17, 1871, as Emperor of the united German
fatherland, crowned with laurels, but giving the
honor to God alone, and stood once more at his
mother&rsquo;s grave in Charlottenburg. How wonderfully
through the grace of God had all her hopes
been realized!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
